        New York, July 19 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a one-year
    high against a basket of currencies on Thursday, gaining for a
    third straight session, as investors further boosted long-term
    bets on the currency following bullish comments this week on the
    U.S. economy by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
        The greenback also climbed to a one-year peak against the
    yuan, as trade worries and reports Beijing would boost liquidity
    in the financial system pressured the Chinese currency.
        The People's Bank of China is channeling credit to small and
    medium-sized firms as the country looks set to loosen monetary
    conditions to lessen the impact of a U.S.-China trade war.
    
        Easier monetary policy tends to weaken a currency. 
        In late morning trading, the dollar index, a gauge of its
    value against a basket of six major currencies, was up
    0.37 percent to 95.432, after touching a one-year high at
    95.652.
        The dollar was up as lower-than-expected jobless claims
    bolstered rate hike expectations after two days of upbeat
    comments on the U.S. economy by the Federal Reserve's chairman.
        On Tuesday and Wednesday, Powell said in congressional
    testimony he believed the United States was on course for years
    more of steady growth, and he carefully played down the risks to
    the U.S. economy of an escalating trade conflict.
        The widening interest rate gap between the United States and
    other major markets has lifted the dollar and prompted analysts
    to expect further strengthening.
        "If you look at the U.S., we're just outpacing everyone in
    terms of rate hikes," said Minh Trang, senior FX trader, Silicon
    Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.
        "That's going to help the dollar long term, and it has
    helped the dollar in the short term as well, obviously."
        The dollar gained against the euro, with the single
    currency sinking 0.3 percent to $1.1600. Against the Japanese
    yen, the dollar rose 0.1 percent to 112.94 yen.

        The Chinese yuan fell 0.8 percent to 6.798 yuan
    per dollar in offshore trading.
        China's Ministry of Commerce said on Wednesday it would have
    to take further measures to compensate for losses caused by U.S.
    tariffs on steel and aluminum 
        U.S. President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Larry
    Kudlow, said on Wednesday he believed Chinese President Xi
    Jinping has blocked progress on a trade deal. China called
    Kudlow's assertions "shocking" and "bogus" on Thursday.
    
        So far this year, the yuan has weakened roughly 4.4 percent
    versus the U.S. dollar.
