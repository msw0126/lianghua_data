# METALS-Copper climbs for second day as metals claw back ground
    
        BEIJING, July 10 (Reuters) - Copper prices in London and
    Shanghai were rising for a second day on Tuesday, with investors
    lured to buy low after a trade war-fuelled sell-off last week.
        The United States on Friday slapped tariffs on $34 billion
    of goods from top metals consumer China, which responded in
    kind. Fears the spat could dampen demand for industrial metals
    had weighed on prices.
            
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal
    Exchange had risen 0.5 percent to $6,423 a tonne by 0150
    GMT, extending a 1.7-percent gain from the previous session. The
    metal lost more than 5 percent last week.

    , however. The metal, used to galvanise steel, fell as
    much as 1.8 percent to 21,855 yuan, having lost 5.3 percent last
    week on trade war fears and expectations of higher supply.
        * RUSAL: United Company Rusal, the world's second
    biggest aluminium producer, in May increased aluminium exports
