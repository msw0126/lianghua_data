# METALS-Shanghai aluminium hits 5-week high; Xi speech in focus
    
        BEIJING, April 10 (Reuters) - Shanghai aluminium prices touched their highest in five weeks on Tuesday, pulled higher by U.S. sanctions on Russian producer United Company Rusal , as most base metals rose ahead of a key speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping.      China, the world's biggest aluminium producer, imported only 14,631 tonnes of primary aluminium from Russia in 2017, according to Chinese customs data, although Russia was still its top supplier of the metal.      Xi is addressing the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan, with investors watching for comments on a brewing U.S.-China trade war that has roiled metals markets.
