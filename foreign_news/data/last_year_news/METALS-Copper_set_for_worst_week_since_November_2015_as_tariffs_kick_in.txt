# METALS-Copper set for worst week since November 2015 as tariffs kick in

        BEIJING, July 6 (Reuters) - London copper recovered
    partially from a fresh 11-month low hit earlier on Friday but
    was still down for a fifth straight session after U.S. tariffs
    on Chinese goods kicked in, escalating the trade spat between
    the world's top two economies.
        Copper, seen as a bellwether for economic health, is down 5
    percent in London this week, putting it on track for its
    steepest weekly drop since the week ended Nov. 20, 2015.
        The United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese
    imports at 0401 GMT. Beijing has promised to retaliate in kind. 
        The U.S.-China trade dispute "looks like becoming
    entrenched" and "comes at a time when copper demand suffers its
    seasonal slowdown," ANZ wrote in a note. 
        "However, we feel the market is oversold. Supply disruptions
    remain a threat, and shifts in China's consumption patterns will
    see demand for refined copper remain strong," it said. 
        "If trade tension subsides, we would expect copper prices to
    recovery strongly" in the second half of 2018, ANZ said.
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal
    Exchange fell as much as 2 percent to $6,221.50 a tonne,
    its lowest since July 25, 2017, before recovering some ground.
    It was down 1 percent at $6,282 at 0735 GMT.
        * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded August copper contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped as much as 2.2
    percent to 48,520 yuan ($7,293.50) a tonne, the lowest since
    July 17, 2017, before closing down 1.1 percent at 49,080 yuan.
    It shed 4.4 percent this week, the most since September 2015.
        * ESCONDIDA: Negotiations between workers and BHP Billiton
    Plc, at the Escondida copper mine in Chile, the
    world's largest, are "far from reaching agreement" with less
    than three weeks to go before the negotiation deadline, a union
    official told Reuters on Thursday.
        * ZINC: Shanghai zinc fell as much as 1.1 percent
    before closing up 0.1 percent amid short covering as the market
    believes the recent sell-off could be overdone, while London
    zinc declined as much as 0.9 percent and is down 6.1
    percent this week, the most since April 2016.
        * ALUMINIUM: Shanghai aluminium closed up 0.4
    percent as Chinese alumina refiners cut production, while London
    aluminium was down 0.2 percent.
