# METALS-Copper loiters near 1-year low as trade tensions simmer
MELBOURNE, July 12 (Reuters) - London copper eased on Thursday after heavy losses in the previous session pushed it to its weakest in a year at one stage as trade tensions between the United States and China undermined confidence in demand for metals. 
### FUNDAMENTALS 
* LME COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper eased by 0.2 percent to $6,132.50 a tonne by 0117 GMT, following steep losses in the previous session when prices dropped as low at $6,081 a tonne at one stage, the weakest since July 25 last year. 
* SHFE COPPER: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper traded flat at 48,400 yuan a tonne, also close to one-year lows.
