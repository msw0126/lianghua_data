# TREASURIES-U.S. yields edge higher ahead of record supply week
    
        By Richard Leong
        NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose on
    Monday as the government planned to sell a record high $294
    billion of debt this week, in a test of investor appetite
    following last week's strong run spurred by nervousness about a
    global trade war.
        The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $51 billion of
    three-month bills and $45 billion of six-month bills at 11:30
    a.m. (1530 GMT), followed by $30 billion of two-year notes at 1
    p.m. (1700 GMT) on Monday.
        "The Treasury market is trading lower this morning as
    traders begin to discount whether there will be an actual 'trade
    war' or if it will be averted, especially with China," said
    Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond
    James in Memphis, Tennessee.
        On Friday, China urged the United States to "pull back from
    the brink" after Trump said he planned tariffs on up to $60
    billion in Chinese goods, and the Chinese commerce ministry
    warned that the country "doesn't hope to be in a trade war, but
    is not afraid of engaging in one."                
        Bloomberg News cited China's ambassador to the United States
    saying that the country was "looking at all options" in response
    to tariffs, which could include scaling back purchases of
    Treasuries.
        At 10:11 a.m. (1411 GMT), the yield on benchmark 10-year
    Treasury notes             was 2.841 percent, up over 1 basis
    point from late Friday.
