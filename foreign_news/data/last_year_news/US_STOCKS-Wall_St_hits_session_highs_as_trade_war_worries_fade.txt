April 10 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes hit session highs on Tuesday as investors concerns about rising U.S.-China trade tension receded after Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to cut import tariffs. 
Ten of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the energy index adding more than 3 percent as oil broke above $70 a barrel. The biggest boost came from a 2.2 percent gain in the technology sector. 
The S&P; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were up more than a percent, while the Dow gained 2 percent with 29 of its 30 components in the positive territory. 
In his first public comments since the trade dispute with the Trump administration started, Xi vowed to open the country's economy and said China would raise the foreign ownership limit in automobile, shipbuilding and aircraft sectors "as soon as possible". 
His comments buoyed global markets, which have been under pressure as China and the United States threatened each other with billions in tariffs and investors feared that protectionist measures would hit global economic growth. 
"What you are seeing in the market is an alleviation of trade war fears and people trying to get back in and reposition themselves for what they hope - no trade war," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.

The so-called FANG stocks - Facebook Inc, Amazon.com , Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google - were up between 1 percent and 2.6 percent ahead of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday.
