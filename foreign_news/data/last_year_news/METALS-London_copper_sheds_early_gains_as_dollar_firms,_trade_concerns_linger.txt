# METALS-London copper sheds early gains as dollar firms, trade concerns linger
    
     (Adds broker comment, updates prices)
        BEIJING, March 28 (Reuters) - London copper gave up early
    gains to trade lower on Wednesday, tracking a decline in
    equities on a firmer U.S. dollar and as global trade tensions
    persisted.
        The dollar index, which gained about 0.3 percent
    overnight, making metals more expensive for holders of other
    currencies and weighing on prices, was trading up 0.2 percent by
    0722 GMT.
        Fears of a trade war between the United States and top
    metals consumer China continued to cast a shadow over the base
    metals market, even as reports of behind-the-scenes talks
    between Washington and Beijing spurred some optimism. 
        Base metals are showing less volatility amid thin trade end
    as the end of the quarter approaches. 
        "Overall it has been a much more sedate session so far today
    both in terms of absolute volumes and ranges with many traders
    staying away from the base metal noise for now," broker Marex
    Spectron said in a note.
