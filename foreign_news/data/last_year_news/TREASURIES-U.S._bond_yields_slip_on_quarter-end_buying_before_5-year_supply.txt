        NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on
    Tuesday as fund managers bought bonds to rebalance their
    portfolios for quarter-end in advance of more government debt
    supply.
        The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $65 billion in
    one-month bills; $24 billion in one-year T-bills
     and $35 billion in five-year notes.
    They are part of this week's record high $294 billion in
    government debt for sale.
        Monday's $30 billion two-year note issue, along with $51
    billion in three-month bills and $45 billion in six-month bills,
    drew mediocre demand, analysts said.
        Lingering worries about a trade war between the United
    States and China have supported safe-haven demand for
    Treasuries, though Wall Street stock prices rose for a second
    day on Tuesday following last week's plunge tied to fears about
    an escalation of trade barriers between the world's two biggest
    economies.
        "Despite today's stock market rebound, 'flight-to-quality'
    sentiment may still linger given market concerns over trade
    policies, which could be supportive for demand," analysts at
    Nomura Securities International wrote in a research note.
        The share of investors who are bullish on longer-dated
    Treasuries rose to its highest level since last June, a survey
    from JPMorgan released on Tuesday showed.
        Moreover, the Conference Board said its gauge of U.S.
    consumer confidence unexpectedly fell to 127.7 in March from a
    revised 130.0 in February.
        At 11:01 a.m. (1501 GMT), the yield on 10-year Treasury
    notes was down 2.2 basis points to 2.819 percent.
        The two-year Treasury yield was down 2.2 basis
    points to 2.294 percent, while the 30-year Treasury yield
     was down 1.4 basis points to 3.057 percent.
