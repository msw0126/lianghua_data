        By Melanie Burton
        MELBOURNE, Oct 23 (Reuters) - London copper pared early
    gains but traded steady on Monday after Chinese authorities
    reaffirmed that the country's economy was on track to achieve
    the official growth target even as its housing market slows.
        China's new home prices registered another month of weak
    growth in September, with the biggest markets slipping and vast
    numbers of smaller cities cooling off as government measures to
    cool a long property boom take hold.
        "Today's Chinese data started on a promising note with
    property price rises almost slowing to a standstill which was
    one of the objectives of the government to both calm inflation
    down and stop investors using property as a speculative
    product," broker Kingdom Futures said in a report.
        "That would come under the heading of so far so good but
    raises the question of where the investors will turn next and
    could they come back into the commodity markets."
        
        * LME COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper erased
    early gains of half a percent to trade flat at $6,950 a tonne by
     0703 GMT, after closing little changed in the previous session,
    when it posted its fourth straight weekly gain. LME copper
    prices reached $7,177 a tonne last week, the highest in three
    years, as manufacturing brightens in Asia, Europe and the United
    States. 
        * SHFE COPPER: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper
    slipped by 0.6 percent to 54,390 yuan ($8,199) a tonne.
       * CHINA ECONOMY: China's economy is on track to meet its
    official growth target for 2017, the head of the state planning
    agency said on Saturday, despite a punishing war on pollution
    which is expected to slash industrial output over the winter
    months.
        * U.S. ECONOMY: President Donald Trump's tax reform plans
    won partial support on Friday when Republican U.S. Senator Rand
    Paul said he was "all in" for massive tax cuts, but the party
    was still far from united over how to achieve the main item on
    its domestic agenda.
        * RECYCLING: After years of dismantling discarded
    televisions and laptops, a Shanghai recycling plant is readying
    itself for a new wave of waste: piles of exhausted batteries
    from the surge of electric vehicles hitting China's streets.
        * INVESTORS: Hedge funds and money managers reduced their
    net long position in COMEX copper contracts to a five-week high
    in the week to Oct. 17, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
    Commission (CFTC) data showed on Friday.
        * ALUMINIUM: U.C. Rusal said that aluminium
    production rose 1.1 percent on the quarter to 931,000 tonnes in
    the third quarter.
        * NICKEL: Nickel volumes surged in line with a rally in
    China steel. "The volumes so far on nickel have been decent and
    in a relatively tight range but given the rally we have seen in
    bulks the move higher has been somewhat muted so far," said
    broker Marex in a report.
