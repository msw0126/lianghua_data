        A QUESTION OF TRUST (1544 GMT)
        On the subject of tech and the implications of Facebook's recent woes, Northern Trust
    Capital Markets' analysts point to one key issue: trust.
        NTCM explores the idea that, as consumers become less trusting of institutions, they will
    revert back to true peer-to-peer platforms.
        "Facebook is built around trust, specifically trust from users that their private
    information won't be used for malicious purposes. With that now in question, so too is their
    value proposition possibly," NTCM's analysts say in a note.
        "In time this could also be seen as a turning point in the advent of the blockchain," they
    add, mentioning their favourite blockchain play, Japan's SBI Holdings while voicing
    concerns around digital advertisers reliant on third-party data.   
        Interesting today that internet company Mozilla has suspended ads on FB on concerns of data
    privacy.
