# METALS-Copper falls after six-day rally, but eyes best week since Feb
    
     (Adds China data, updates prices)

        MANILA, June 8 (Reuters) - London copper retreated on Friday
    after a six-day rally that pushed the metal to its strongest in
    4-1/2 years in the previous session on worries over potential
    supply disruptions, but data showing strong Chinese imports
    helped limit losses.
        Copper imports by China, the world's top consumer, climbed
    to the highest in 17 months in May.
        Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was
    down 1 percent at $7,259 a tonne by 0712 GMT, off a session low
    of $7,211. The contract touched $7,348 on Thursday, its loftiest
    since January 2014, and has risen 5 percent so far this week,
    the most since mid-February.
        The workers' union at the BHP-operated
    Escondida copper mine in Chile last week kicked off labor
    negotiations with a contract proposal that includes a bonus of
    about $34,000 per worker, sparking fears of a possible strike.
    
        ANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes said the
    Escondida union's bonus proposal compares with BHP's offer of
    $21,300, "therefore, both parties reaching a deal looks
    difficult at the moment, leaving room for a strike."
        "The union has enough cash to go on a strike of 44 days.
    This deal is important for the other wage contract renewals too.
    We see prices remaining volatile until they reach an agreement,"
    Hynes said in a report this week.
                
        * CHINA COPPER IMPORTS: China imported 475,000 tonnes of
    unwrought copper and copper products last month, customs data
    showed, the largest since December 2016. It was the highest May
    figure for at least a decade, up 22 percent from the same month
    last year and up 8 percent from April.
        * CHINA TRADE: China's overall exports grew 12.6 percent in
    May, slightly slower than in April, while imports jumped 26
    percent, outpacing market expectations and the fastest pace
    since January.
        * SHANGHAI COPPER: The most-traded August copper contract on
    the Shanghai Futures Exchange slipped 0.3 percent to
    close at 53,780 yuan ($8,391) a tonne.
        * CHILE OUTPUT: Chile's copper production in April jumped
    6.4 percent from the same month a year earlier, Chilean copper
    commission Cochilco said, boosted by increased output at large,
    privately held mines in the world's top copper producer.
    
        * DOLLAR: The dollar wallowed near a three-week low against
    peers as U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply, while the euro's
    recovery remained intact amid expectations that the European
    Central Bank would begin unwinding it stimulus programme.
        * TRUMP: Leaders of the Group of Seven rich nations are set
    to clash with a combative U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday
    when they pressure him to lift sanctions on steel and aluminium
    they fear could lead to a trade war.
        * OTHER METALS: Other metals also slipped, with LME lead
     down 1.9 percent at $2,487 a tonne, after hitting a
    three-month high on Thursday, and nickel dropping 1.3
    percent to $15,320. Shanghai lead fell 1.3 percent to
    20,385 yuan a tonne and nickel lost 2.5 percent to
    114,900 yuan.
