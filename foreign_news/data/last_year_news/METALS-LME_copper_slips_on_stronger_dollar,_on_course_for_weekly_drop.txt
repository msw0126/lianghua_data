# METALS-LME copper slips on stronger dollar, on course for weekly drop
    
        BEIJING, March 16 (Reuters) - Copper prices fell on Friday
    as the dollar strengthened ahead of next week's Federal Open
    Market Committee meeting, at which the U.S. central bank is
    expected to raise interest rates for the first time this year.  
        A stronger greenback makes metals more expensive for holders
    of other currencies and can weigh on prices. 
            
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal
    Exchange was down 0.1 percent at $6,914 a tonne by 0210
    GMT, extending a 1 percent loss in the previous session. It is
    on course for a 0.7 percent weekly drop.
        * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded May copper contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange was down 0.8 percent to
    51,960 yuan ($8,206) a tonne but on track for a weekly gain of
    0.8 percent.
        * NICKEL: Shanghai nickel was the biggest loser in
    early trade, slipping 1 percent to 103,060 yuan a tonne but
    still up 2.2 percent for the week.
        * COPPER: The Democratic Republic of Congo is considering
    adding copper to its list of strategic minerals in a move that
    would extract higher fees from mining companies, an adviser to
    the prime minister said on Thursday.
        * ALUMINIUM: The U.S. International Trade Commission said on
    Thursday it had made a final finding that imports of aluminium
    foil from China hurt U.S. producers, a move that locks in place
    hefty duties of up to 188 percent on Chinese exporters.
    
        * ALUMINA: Norsk Hydro Asa sees securing
    alternative sources of alumina to replace reduced supplies at
    its Brazilian plant as a priority, Chief Executive Svein Richard
    Brandtzaeg told Reuters.        
         * TARIFFS: U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and European
    Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom have agreed to meet next
    week in an attempt to resolve a deepening dispute over trade
    tariffs, a European Commission source said on Thursday.

    over the U.S. investigation into the Trump Organization tested
    investor nerves, already frayed by fears U.S. tariffs could hurt
    the global economy and trigger a trade war.
