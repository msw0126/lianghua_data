# METALS-Metal prices slip as trade war concerns resurface

        MELBOURNE/BEIJING, March 7 (Reuters) - London metals slipped on Wednesday on
    the resignation of Gary Cohn, a key advocate for free trade in the White House,
    rekindling fears U.S. President Donald Trump would go ahead with tariffs on
    metal imports and risk a trade war.    
        Cohn, an economic adviser seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces
    within Trump's administration, said on Tuesday he would resign, a move that came
    after he lost a fight over Trump's plans for hefty steel and aluminium import
    tariffs.     
        The threat of a trade war has led to speculative buying, Kingdom Futures CEO
    Malcolm Freeman wrote in a note, on expectations that metal will be harder and
    more expensive to come by when the tariffs are imposed. However, there has so
    far been little increase in real consumer buying, he added. 
        "The net result of this could well be another sharp correction to the
    downside in prices until the markets get into synchronisation and consumer
    buying starts up again," Freeman said.
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper was down 0.5 percent at
    $6,970 a tonne, as of 0730 GMT, shedding gains of 1.4 percent from the previous
    session. Prices have traded in a $6,850-$7,250 range since mid-February. "A
    softer dollar brought copper up above $7,000 last night, but I think fear is on
    again," said a trader in Singapore.
        * LME OPTIONS: Traders of LME calls and puts, the right to buy or sell a
    contract at a fixed price later, must decide today, the first Wednesday of the
    month, whether to exercise their options.      
        * SHFE COPPER: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper closed 0.3 percent
    higher at 52,480 yuan ($8,299.33) a tonne.
        * DOLLAR: The greenback extended its retreat on Wednesday after Cohn
    resigned.
        * CHINA ECONOMY: China is fully confident of its ability to fend off
    systemic debt risks while authorities expect no significant changes in
    government debt ratio in the coming years, finance minister Xiao Jie said on
    Wednesday.
        * ZINC: Brazilian miner Nexa Resources expects demand for
    zinc to outpace supply, keeping prices for the metal at $3,400 to $3,500 a ton
    for the rest of the year, Chief Executive Tito Martins said on Tuesday. 
    
         * ZINC: Premiums for zinc in Shanghai bond have sunk to the weakest since
    May last year at $145-170, latest data shows, after exchange stocks in the U.S.
    surged this week, soothing supply concerns. ZN-BMPBW-SHMET
