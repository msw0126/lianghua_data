        NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - Treasuries yields rose on
    Monday afternoon as the U.S. stock market recovered and fears of
    a trade war eased after senior Republicans urged President
    Donald Trump to reconsider his threat to impose tariffs on
    imported steel and aluminum. 
        U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan urged the Trump administration
    to hold off on implementing new tariffs, citing risks to the
    economy. Fellow Republican Kevin Brady, the top House legislator
    on trade, said American consumers should not be forced to pay
    more for goods.
        President Trump nevertheless said he was not backing down on
    the plan, saying he did not think there would be a trade war due
    to the tariffs. Trump has touted the planned tariffs as a way to
    revive the U.S. steel and aluminum industries. 
        "A trade war on steel and aluminum is going to help a small
    number of people and it's going to hurt a lot more and drive up
    prices," said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president, fixed income
    trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle.
        The S&P; 500 Index was up 1.2 percent from Friday's
    close, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.4
    percent. The yield on the U.S. benchmark government bond
     was last at 2.884 percent, up 2.7 basis points from
    its last close.
        Trump's determination to push ahead with a 25 percent tariff
    on steel imports and a 10 percent duty on aluminum has prompted
    threats of retaliation from the European Union, Canada, China
    and Brazil, among others. It roiled world stock markets as
    investors worried that a trade war could derail global economic
    growth.
        Chinese retaliation, for example, could take the form of
    counter-tariffs or a central bank sell-off of U.S. Treasuries. 
        "I don't think a trade war characterized by central bank
    dumping of Treasuries is really on the radar. But we could be in
    for a period of retaliatory industry-specific tariffs," said Ian
    Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in
    New York. 
        The expectation U.S. pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp
    would issue over $40 billion in new supply this week to fund its
    acquisition of health insurance company Aetna also
    boosted yields on Monday. Without an additional bump
    in demand, large issuances of debt will drive down prices of
    fixed-income products.
        "There are thoughts there is going to be rate-lock selling.
    The supply on the corporate end is a factor that's really
    hurting Treasuries," said Hurley. 
        Yields were higher along the curve, but all traded within
    last week's range. U.S. 2-year Treasury yields were
    last at 2.244 percent. The long end was also under pressure,
    with 30-year yields last at 3.16 percent.
