# METALS-London copper climbs off 3-month low on dovish Fed
    
        MELBOURNE, March 22 (Reuters) - London copper climbed off
    its lowest in three months on Thursday after the U.S. Federal
    Reserve signalled a slower pace of rate rises this year, which
    weighed on the dollar. 
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * London Metal Exchange copper traded at $6,838 a
    tonne by 0230 GMT, extending a small recovery from the previous
    session, when prices plumbed a three month trough at $6702 but
    finished up half a percent. 
        * Shanghai Futures Exchange copper rose 0.9 percent
    to 51270 yuan ($8,117) a tonne. 
        * The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on
    Wednesday and forecast two more hikes for 2018 in its first
    policy meeting under new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
    
        * President Donald Trump will announce tariffs on Chinese
    imports on Thursday, a White House official said, in a move
    aimed at curbing theft of U.S. technology and likely to trigger
    retaliation from Beijing and stoke fears of a global trade war.
    
        * Swiss prosecutors confirmed on Wednesday they were
    investigating whether miner Rio Tinto paid bribes linked
    to the landmark Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine.
        * Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace
    in March than the previous month as growth in new orders and
    output moderated, in a sign that the economy may be losing a
    little momentum.
        * Among other metals, LME aluminium rallied more
    than 1 percent, breaking back above the 200-day moving average
    after closing below the key technical level for two sessions in
    a row. 
        * Shfe aluminium however was flirting with its
    weakest levels in 14 months, around 13,820 yuan, with more China
    production expected to come on stream in coming weeks after the
    expiration of the country's winter pollution controls.

        * The U.S. dollar was on the defensive on Thursday after
    posting its largest loss in two months when the Federal Reserve
    turned out to be less hawkish than anticipated.
