# METALS- London metals fall on stronger dollar, simmering trade concerns
    
        MELBOURNE, March 19 (Reuters) - London metals slipped on
    Monday on simmering unease that tensions between the world's top
    two economies could dent metals demand, while markets eyed this
    week's Federal Reserve meeting that could fuel fresh upward
    momentum in the dollar. 
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper slipped 0.8
    percent to $6,833 a tonne by 0203 GMT, extending losses from
    Friday when prices fell half a percent. 
        * Prices dropped to $6,811,  which was the weakest since
    March 9 when copper troughed at $6,777, a break of which would
    open the way to mid-February lows. Support is seen at the 200
    day moving average of $6,657.
        * SHFE: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper fell 1.2
    percent to 51,310 yuan ($8,100) a tonne, the steepest decline
    among Shanghai metals.    
        * SHFE ALUMINIUM: In China, metals inventories have built
    despite pollution controls that curbed factory output. Shanghai
    aluminium stocks surged by 87,303 tonnes to a record high of
    934,216 tonnes, data on Friday showed. <AL-STX-SGH > 
        * STOCKS: Shanghai zinc stocks also jumped by around 50,000
    tonnes over the past month ZN-STX-SGH, while Shanghai copper
    stocks have nearly doubled since the start of the year,
    approaching 300,000 tonnes. CU-STX-SGH
        * RISK APPETITE: Worries about the potential for a
    U.S.-China trade war and frustration over U.S. President Donald
    Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs threatened to dominate a
    gathering of finance leaders amid strengthening growth.
    
        * DOLLAR: The dollar started the week little changed on
    Monday as traders set sights on new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome
    Powell's first monetary policy meeting later in the week and as
    the increased threat of trade protectionism kept markets on
    edge.
        * POLLUTION: China will set more stringent targets for
    improving the nation's air quality under a new three-year plan,
    as Beijing prepares to beef up a nationwide crackdown on
    polluters in its years-long campaign to clear its notoriously
    toxic skies.
        * COPPER: Polish copper producer KGHM said it
    expects daily copper ore output at its Chilean mine Sierra Gorda
    to increase by 18 percent next year from current levels.

        * INVESTORS: Hedge funds and money managers trimmed their
    net long positions in COMEX copper contracts in the week to
    March 13, regulatory data showed on Friday.

        * Asian share markets got off to a hesitant start on Monday
    for a week in which the Federal Reserve is likely to deliver a
    hike in U.S. interest rates and perhaps signal that as many as
    three more lie in store for the rest of the year.
