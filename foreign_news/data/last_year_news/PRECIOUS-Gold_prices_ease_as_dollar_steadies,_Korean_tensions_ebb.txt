        BENGALURU, April 30 (Reuters) - Gold prices inched down on
    Monday as the U.S. dollar steadied and as signs of easing
    tensions on the Korean peninsula reduced safe-haven demand for
    the metal.  
        Spot gold        had fallen 0.3 percent to $1,318.23 per
    ounce by 0639 GMT. U.S. gold futures         for June delivery
    declined 0.3 percent to $1,319.20 per ounce. Prices have dropped
    about 0.5 percent so far in April.
        "Gold is still tracked very closely with the dollar," said
    Helen Lau, analyst at Argonaut Securities.
        The dollar index       , which touched a 3-1/2-month high of
    91.986 on Friday, was steady at 91.543.       
        The greenback has risen as much as 1.7 percent so far this
    month, its strongest monthly gain since November, 2016. 
        Markets were mostly quiet on Monday with Japan, China and
    India on holiday and as much of Asia will be closed on Tuesday. 
        "Geopolitical risks also seem to be turning around ...
    Everybody want to come to the table and negotiate a deal," Lau
    added. 
        At their summit on Friday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un
    Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared they would
    take steps to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended
    only with a truce, and work towards the "denuclearisation" of
    the Korean peninsula.             
        Separately, a delegation of U.S. officials, including
    Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Donald Trump's
    top economic and trade advisers are all expected in China later
    this week for trade negotiations.             
        Gold is often used as a store of value during times of
    financial or political uncertainty.
        "Gold positions continued to be rolled back as the markets
    are adjusting portfolios given the increased potential for the
    dollar to rise in the weeks ahead becomes a reality," said
    Stephen Innes, APAC trading head at OANDA.
        Hedge funds and money managers trimmed their net long
    position in COMEX gold contracts and switched to a net long
    position in silver contracts in the week to April 24, U.S.
    Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed on
    Friday.             
        Spot gold looks neutral in a range of $1,317-$1,326 per
    ounce, and an escape could suggest a direction, according to
    Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.             
        Among other precious metals silver        was down 0.6
    percent at $16.40 per ounce, after it touched a three-week low
    of $16.37. However, prices are up about 0.7 percent for April so
    far.
        Platinum        was down 0.5 percent at $906.00 per ounce
    and was on track to record its third consecutive monthly fall,
    down over 2 percent.
        Palladium        fell 0.5 percent to $969.22 per ounce, but
    was set to post its biggest monthly gain since December.
