        NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - The dollar, yen and Swiss
    franc rose on Tuesday as traders piled into perceived less risky
    currencies after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap
    more tariffs on China, fanning a trade dispute between the
    world's two biggest economies.
        Trump said he would impose a 10 percent tariff on $200
    billion of Chinese goods, following levies on $50 billion worth
    of Chinese imports enacted last week.
        China's commerce ministry warned on Tuesday that Beijing
    would fight back firmly with "qualitative" and "quantitative"
    measures if the United States implements more tariffs. 
        Fears of a trade war that could harm global growth spurred
    sales of the Chinese yuan, which fell to a five-month trough in
    the offshore market, as well as commodity-linked and emerging
    market currencies. 
        Worries about a growing U.S.-China trade spat also sparked a
    selloff in stock markets around the world.
        "A pending trade war and a selloff in global equities is
    benefiting the yen and dollar," said John Doyle, vice president
    of dealing and trading at Tempus Inc in Washington. "Emerging
    market currencies, especially the South African rand, are taking
    the bulk of the heat."
        The index that tracks the greenback against the euro, yen,
    sterling and three other currencies reached 95.296, the
    highest since last July. It was last up 0.35 percent at 95.133.
        The yen climbed 0.5 percent at 109.95 yen per dollar,
    while it advanced 1 percent versus the euro to 127.09 yen
    , its strongest in over two weeks.
        The Swiss franc increased 0.6 percent against the euro at
    1.1495 franc and was marginally higher versus the
    greenback at 0.9948 franc.
        Among the day's losers, the yuan weakened to 6.491 to the
    dollar in the offshore market, the lowest in five
    months.
        "Of course a far-reaching trade war would be detrimental for
    everyone in the end, but mainly the countries whose growth
    heavily depends on foreign trade," said Commerzbank currency
    strategist Thu Lan Nguyen in Frankfurt.     
        The Australian dollar sagged to a one-year low of
    $0.73475 as the trade tension hurt base metal prices.
    
        The Canadian dollar fell to a one-year low of C$1.3291 on
    worries about Canada's own trade feud with the United States.
    
        In emerging markets, the South African rand tumbled
    to its weakest level in nearly seven months at 13.7895 rand per
    dollar.
        In addition to trade concerns, the euro slumped to a
    two-week low of $1.1528 after European Central Bank President
    Mario Draghi called for a patient approach to European monetary
    policy at a forum in Portugal. 
        The single currency was also under pressure as German
    Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies may defy her by
    implementing a plan to limit immigration at the German border,
    which could destabilise her three-month-old coalition.
