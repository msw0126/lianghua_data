        TORONTO, March 26 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index

    receded.

        * The materials group, which includes precious and base
    metals miners as well as fertilizer companies, added 0.8
    percent.
        * Industrials rose 0.8 percent as railroad shares climbed
    and financials, which account for more than one-third of the
    weight of the TSX, gained 0.3 percent.

        * The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Birchcliff
