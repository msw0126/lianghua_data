# METALS-Shanghai metals claw back more ground after trade war sell-off
    
     (Adds Shanghai closing prices, updates London prices)
        BEIJING, June 28 (Reuters) - Shanghai base metals prices
    rose on Thursday, with lead hitting a 19-month high, as they
    continued to recover from a sell-off triggered by trade war
    tensions between top metals consumer China and the United
    States.
        Lead prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) rose for
    a fourth straight day, by as much as 3 percent to 20,615 yuan
    ($3,116.45) a tonne, the highest since Nov. 29, 2016, as an
    environmental crackdown in top producer China raised fears of
    tight supply.      
        "China's lead production will remain under pressure over the
    coming years on the back of government-led consolidations and
    closures due to environmental concerns," BMI Research wrote in a
    note. BMI forecasts that China's lead output will see an average
    annual growth of 1.8 percent over 2018-27.
        In contrast, dollar-denominated London metals prices fell
    across the board, tracking equities lower and as the greenback
     strengthened, making metals more expensive for holders of
    other currencies.
                
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LEAD: The most-traded August lead contract on the
    ShFE closed up 2.9 percent at 20,595 yuan per tonne and is on
    course to gain 16 percent in the second quarter, with one
    trading day remaining. London lead slipped 0.5 percent
    to $2,423.50 per tonne as of 0711 GMT.
        COPPER: The ShFE's most-traded August copper contract
     closed up 0.1 percent at 51,640 yuan a tonne.
    Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange edged
    down 0.2 percent to $6,677 a tonne, extending a 0.3 percent fall
    in the previous session.
        * COPPER: China's top copper smelters on Thursday failed to
    set minimum treatment and refining charges (TC/RCs) for copper
    concentrate in the third quarter of 2018, two people with
    knowledge of the matter said.
        * OTHER METALS: Shanghai zinc closed up 1.5
    percent, nickel added 1.2 percent and aluminium
     nudged up 0.3 percent.
        * ZINC: Australia's New Century Resources is on
    track to turn a giant tailings dam into the world's
    fifth-biggest source of zinc as it defies doubters to make its
    first shipment in August, said Patrick Walta, the mineral
    processor's managing director.

        * Asian stocks slumped to nine-month lows on Thursday as
    investors worried that the Trump administration's approach to
    trade is harming global economic growth - even as the White
    House approach to Chinese investment in U.S. technology
    companies appeared to be softening.
