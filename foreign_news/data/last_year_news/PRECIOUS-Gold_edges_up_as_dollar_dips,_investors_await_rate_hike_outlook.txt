# PRECIOUS-Gold edges up as dollar dips, investors await rate hike outlook
    
        March 21 (Reuters) - Gold prices inched up on Wednesday as
    the dollar crept lower, while investors awaited the conclusion
    of U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day meet for clues on faster
    monetary tightening, expecting the first rate increase of the
    year later in the day.
        
        FUNDAMENTALS  
        * Spot gold        was up 0.1 percent at $1,311.72 per
    ounce, as of 0118 GMT. Prices hit a nearly three-week low in the
    previous session at $1,306.91.
        * U.S. gold futures         for April delivery was flat at
    $1,311.60 per ounce.
        * The dollar index        against a basket of currencies was
    down 0.1 percent at 90.305 after climbing to 90.445 on Tuesday, 
    its highest in almost three weeks.       
        * U.S. lawmakers neared agreement on Tuesday on a massive
    government spending bill that Congress hopes to pass by Friday,
    as congressional leaders worked to narrow their differences on
    thorny issues such as President Donald Trump's border wall.
                
        * The world's financial leaders rejected protectionism on
    Tuesday and urged "further dialogue" on trade, but failed to
    diffuse the threat of a trade war days before U.S. metals
    tariffs take effect and Washington is to announce measures
    against China.              
        * Voicing hopes that Beijing and the United States could
    avoid a trade war, Premier Li Keqiang told the close of the
    annual parliament session that China would open its economy
    further, so that foreign and Chinese firms can compete on an
    equal footing.             
        * British inflation was weaker than expected in February as
    the impact of the 2016 Brexit vote faded from the figures,
    easing some of the squeeze on consumers who have seen their pay
    rise more slowly than prices.             
        * Investment bank Goldman Sachs downgraded its forecasts for
    India's economy on Tuesday in the wake of a more than $2 billion
    fraud at Punjab National Bank          , warning it could spark
    tighter regulation of the banking sector that would constrain
    credit growth.             
        * SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed
    exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.04 percent to
    850.54 tonnes on Tuesday from 850.84 tonnes on Monday. 
                
        * Russia's gold reserves stood at 60.5 million troy ounces
    at the beginning of March, the central bank said on Tuesday.
