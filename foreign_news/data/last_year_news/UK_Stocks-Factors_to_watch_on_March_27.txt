        March 27 (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index is
    seen opening 78 points higher at 6,966 on Tuesday, according to
    financial bookmakers.  
        
        * GSK: Novartis will sell its 36.5 percent stake in
    a consumer healthcare joint venture to GSK for $13.0
    billion in cash to focus on strategic priorities, the Swiss
    drugmaker said on Tuesday.
        * SHELL: The heavy oil hydrocracker was shut on Monday at
    Royal Dutch Shell Plc's 227,586-barrel-per-day (bpd)
    Convent, Louisiana, refinery, said sources familiar with plant
    operations.
        * GOLD: Gold prices inched lower early Tuesday amid reports
    of trade negotiations between the United States and China, which
    eased fears of a trade war and improved investors' appetite for
    riskier assets.
        * OIL: Oil prices rose on Tuesday, pushed up by concerns
    that tensions in the Middle East could lead to supply
    disruptions.
        * The UK blue chip FTSE 100 index fell 0.4 percent
    and closed at 6.888.7 points on Monday, reversing earlier gains
    and joining a broader pull-back in Europe where diplomatic
    tensions with Russia helped more than offset easing trade war
    fears.
