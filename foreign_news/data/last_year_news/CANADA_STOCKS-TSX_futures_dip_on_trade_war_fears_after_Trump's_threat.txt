# CANADA STOCKS-TSX futures dip on trade war fears after Trump's threat
Stock futures pointed to a lower opening for Canada's main stock index on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump warned of more tariffs on China, fanning fears of a trade war between the two countries. 
China said it would fight back with fresh trade measures if the United States continues with protectionism, hours after Trump threatened to slap an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods.
