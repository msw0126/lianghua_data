# U.S. fund investors cut stocks for 2nd straight week -ICI
    
        By Trevor Hunnicutt
        NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Investors gashed U.S.-based
    stock funds, withdrawing billions of dollars for the second
    straight week, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on
    Wednesday.
        Stock mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United
    States recorded $11.9 billion of withdrawals for the week ended
    March 28, after $13.8 billion poured out the week prior, the
    trade group's data showed.
        The possibility of a trade war between the United States and
    China added to existing concerns weighing on investors about the
    possibility that higher inflation and interest rates could
    derail markets.
        President Donald Trump's administration signaled on
    Wednesday that proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese
    goods may be a negotiating tactic in the escalating trade fight
    in which China retaliated by targeting key American imports with
    similar duties.
        Fritz Folts, chief investment strategist at 3EDGE Asset
    Management LP, said his company reduced its exposure to the
    equity market in the first quarter due to rising short-term
    interest rates and the fact that markets started demanding a
    higher premium for corporate bonds.
        "We are well positioned should equities continue to
    struggle," he said.
        "What we need to pay close attention to is the possibility
    of a 'snap-back' equity rally perhaps in response to a blow-out
    corporate earnings reporting season. Should that occur then we
    would need to reconsider perhaps putting equity exposure back on
    in our strategies."
        Major companies start to report quarterly earnings this
    month, with investors expecting strong profit growth. Wall
    Street analysts expect first-quarter S&P; 500 profits to
    rise by 18 percent over the year before, helped by tax cuts
    passed in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
        In the meantime, markets are contending with temperamental
    sentiment. Domestic stock fund outflows totaled $12.6 billion,
    according to ICI.
        International stock funds, which have taken in money for 69
    weeks straight, took in just $628 million during the latest
    week, the least in nearly 15 months. Bond funds attracted $465
    million, the lowest amount in six weeks.
        Commodity funds, which invest in assets including gold,
    posted $332 million in withdrawals, the most cash pulled out of
    that area of the market since February 2017.
        The following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual
    funds and ETFs (all figures in million of dollars):
