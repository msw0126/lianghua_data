# METALS-Shanghai zinc jumps as much as 6 pct as supply tightens
    
        BEIJING, July 19 (Reuters) - Shanghai zinc soared as much as
    6 percent to a one-week high on Thursday after data showed a
    year-on-year drop in Chinese production and the London Metal
    Exchange (LME) zinc price posted its biggest daily jump in
    almost a year. 
        The metal, used to galvanise steel, had fallen by around 23
    percent in London in June and July amid fears of oversupply
    before short-covering kicked in on expectations that the
    sell-off was overdone.    
            
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * SHANGHAI ZINC: The most-traded September zinc contract on
    the Shanghai Futures Exchange hit the daily upside
    limit of 6 percent in early trade, touching its highest since
    July 10, and was up 4.9 percent at 21,405 yuan ($3,183.33) at
    0157 GMT. 
        * LME ZINC: Three-month zinc on the LME rose as much
    as 2.1 percent to $2,655 a tonne, extending a 3.5 percent gain
    on Wednesday, its biggest daily jump since last August, before
    easing back to $2,608.
        * CHINA: China's June zinc output fell 5 percent
    year-on-year to 475,000 tonnes, the National Bureau of
    Statistics said on Wednesday. 
        * TECHNICALS: Indicating near-term supply tightness in zinc,
    LME cash zinc traded at a premium of $31 a tonne to the
    three-month price CMZN0-3, up from an $8.50 premium on July
    12.    
        * OTHER METALS: All other base metals were trading higher
    with the exception of London nickel, which edged down
    0.3 percent. Copper added 0.9 percent in Shanghai and 0.4
    percent in London, but zinc's sister metal lead was the next
    best performer, jumping 1.7 percent in Shanghai. 
        * COPPER: Three senior executives at Jiangxi Copper Co
    , one of China's biggest copper producers,
    have left their roles, the company said in a stock exchange
    filing on Wednesday, in a major managerial shake-up at the
    state-run firm. {nH9N1UC00Q]
        * ALCOA: Aluminium producer Alcoa Corp lowered its
    forecast for adjusted earnings before interest, tax,
    depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2018 on Wednesday,
    citing U.S. tariffs on imported aluminium and rising energy
    costs.
