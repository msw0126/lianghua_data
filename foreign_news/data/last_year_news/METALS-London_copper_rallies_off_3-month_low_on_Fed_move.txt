# METALS-London copper rallies off 3-month low on Fed move
    
     (Adds comment, updates prices)
        By Melanie Burton
        MELBOURNE, March 22 (Reuters) - London copper climbed off
    its lowest in three months on Thursday after the U.S. Federal
    Reserve signalled a slower pace of rate rises this year, which
    weighed on the dollar. 
        "Post the FED rate hike and forward guidance on an
    additional two hikes, the market found reason to re-assert the
    bearish USD theme and this in turn has boosted the USD
    denominated commodities markets," said Marex Spectron in a
    report.
        "The positive short-term technical picture across the LME
    complex combined with the USD weakness should inspire further
    short-covering today with room to run on some of these metals
    given their positioning."  
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper traded up 0.5
    percent at $6,830 a tonne by 0725 GMT, extending a small
    recovery from the previous session, when prices plumbed a
    three-month trough at $6702 but finished up half a percent.
    Shanghai Futures Exchange copper rose 0.8 percent.
        * FEDERAL RESERVE: The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest
    rates on Wednesday and forecast two more hikes for 2018 in its
    first policy meeting under new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
    
        * DOLLAR: The U.S. dollar was on the defensive on Thursday
    after posting its largest loss in two months when the Federal
    Reserve turned out to be less hawkish than anticipated.
        * TARIFFS: President Donald Trump will announce tariffs on
    Chinese imports on Thursday, a White House official said, in a
    move aimed at curbing theft of U.S. technology and likely to
    trigger retaliation from Beijing and stoke fears of a global
    trade war.
        * CHINA: China accused the United States of "repeatedly
    abusing" trade practices, as Beijing braced on Thursday for an
    imminent announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump slapping
    more tariffs on Chinese imports.
        * RIO TINTO: Swiss prosecutors confirmed on Wednesday they
    were investigating whether miner Rio Tinto paid bribes
    linked to the landmark Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine.
        * ALUMINIUM: Among other metals, LME aluminium pared
    more than 1 percent gains to $2,094, still up 0.6 percent,
    having broken back above the 200-day moving average after
    closing below the key technical level for two sessions in a row.
        * Shfe aluminium however was flirting with its
    weakest levels in 14 months, around 13,820 yuan, with more China
    production expected to come on stream in coming weeks after the
    expiration of the country's winter pollution controls. 
        * Shfe lead rallied more than 3 percent, partly due
    to a technical breakout based on gains in sister-metal zinc,
    where available exchange-based inventories have dwindled.
