# METALS-London copper prices edge up on softer U.S. dollar
    
        BEIJING, March 28 (Reuters) - London copper prices ticked
    upward for a second day on Wednesday as the U.S. dollar, which
    had gained about 0.3 percent overnight, lost ground on lingering
    global trade tensions. 
        A weaker greenback makes metals cheaper for holders of other
    currencies and can support prices.
       
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal
    Exchange (LME) was up 0.2 percent at $6,665 a tonne by
    0219 GMT, extending a 0.7 percent gain in the previous session. 
      
        * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded May copper contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange gained 0.3 percent to 49,590
    yuan ($7,898.01) a tonne.
        * OTHER METALS: The entire Shanghai base metals complex
    moved forward as the dollar index slipped by 0.1 percent
    to 89.29, while aluminium was flat in London and LME
    lead shed 0.3 percent.
        * COPPER: Vedanta Resources Plc said on Tuesday its
    India unit Vedanta Ltd's copper smelting operations at
    Thootukudi, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, will be closed
    for about 15 days as part of a maintenance shutdown.  
    
        * ALUMINIUM: China's northern province of Shanxi on Tuesday
    offered some of the country's biggest aluminium companies
    preferential access to bauxite resources if they transfer
    smelting capacity to the region.
        * ALUMINA: The Alunorte refinery in northern Brazil, owned
    by Norway's Norsk Hydro ASA, will start shutting down
    half of its alumina capacity in the next two weeks to preserve
    equipment, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
