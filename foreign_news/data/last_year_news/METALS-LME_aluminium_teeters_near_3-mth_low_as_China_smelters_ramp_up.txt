# METALS-LME aluminium teeters near 3-mth low as China smelters ramp up
    
        MELBOURNE, March 15 (Reuters) - London aluminium hovered
    near its lowest since late December on Thursday on expectations
    of rising supply as China's winter pollution controls expire.
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * ALUMINIUM: London Metal Exchange aluminium crept
    up 0.2 percent to $2,094 a tonne, having slipped to the weakest
    since Dec. 19 at $2,087 on Wednesday. Support is seen at the 200
    moving day average at $2,083, a break of which could trigger a
    steeper correction, as it would send a sell signal to momentum
    following funds.
        * SHFE: Shanghai aluminium hit its lowest in 14
    months at 13,820 yuan ($2,191) on Tuesday and last traded at
    13,950 yuan.
        * SMOG: The winter heating season ended on Thursday.
    Aluminium smelters in 28 northern Chinese cities had been told
    to reduce output by at least 30 percent from Nov. 15 to March
    15, although the actual volume cut was below expectations,
    putting pressure on prices.
        * OUTPUT: China's aluminium production fell 1.8 percent in
    January-February from a year earlier, data showed on Wednesday,
    as the country's pollution crackdown and supply-side reform
    kicked in. An estimated 4.4 million tonnes of new capacity are
    expected to be completed this year 
        * STOCKS: Shfe aluminium AL-STX-SGH stockpiles held at
    exchange warehouses are within a whisker of record highs near
    850,000 tonnes, reflecting a surplus of domestic material. 
        * DISCOUNT: The discount between cash Shfe and
    physical prices AL-A00-CCNMM has narrowed to 35 yuan from 385
    three weeks ago, reflecting a tightening market and an expected
    pick-up in nearby demand. 
        * COPPER: LME copper traded up 0.3 percent at $7,006
    a tonne by 0157 GMT, adding to 0.6 percent gains from the
    previous session. Prices are expected to rise over the coming
    month as industrial production in the seasonally strongest
    second quarter ramps up.
        * TRADE: The Trump administration is pressing China to cut
    its trade surplus with the United States by $100 billion, a
    White House spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
        * COBALT: Glencore, the world's biggest producer of
    cobalt, has agreed to sell around a third of its cobalt
    production over the next three years to Chinese battery recycler
    GEM.
        * SMOG: Eastern China's Jiangsu province will step up its
    war on pollution and focus on "high-quality development"
    following a spike in smog early this year.
        * DOLLAR: Supporting metals, the dollar fell against the yen
    on Thursday as lingering worries about global trade tensions
    weighed on investors' risk appetite.
