# TREASURIES-Yields rise from six-week lows as stocks retrace losses
* Yields rise as stocks recover 
* Capital goods orders rebounded in February

NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose from to six-week lows on Friday as stocks appeared stronger, after tumbling on Thursday on concerns about global trade wars. 
China urged the United States on Friday to "pull back from the brink" as President Donald Trump's plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods moved the world's two largest economies closer to a trade war. 
Stocks markets fell globally as investors feared the impact of tariffs on global growth, before retracing some of their losses on Friday morning. 
"Equity markets seem to be coming off their lows quite nicely," said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. "We're getting a little bit of a rubber band rebound from yesterday's risk off rally in Treasuries." 
Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 5/32 in price on the day to yield 2.850 percent, after falling to a six-week low of 2.792 percent overnight. 
With no large catalysts in the near-term expected to set market direction investors are focusing on headlines coming out of Washington. 
Data on Friday showed that new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rebounded more than expected in February after two straight monthly declines and shipments surged, pointing to strong growth in business spending on equipment in the first quarter. (Editing by Steve Orlofsky) )
