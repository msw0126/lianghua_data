        NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors pulled
    back from the stock market for a third straight week,
    withdrawing $11.6 billion in cash in the week ended Wednesday,
    in the face of a potential full-blown trade war between the
    United States and China, Lipper data showed on Thursday.
        The markets have rocked back and forth over the past week on
    shifting sentiments of the likelihood of an all-out trade war.
    China retaliated on Wednesday against planned U.S. tariffs by
    targeting key U.S. products, though the United States later
    voiced willingness to negotiate a resolution.
        "It makes sense that there's money flowing out of equities
    with everything we were seeing in the market," said Pat Keon,
    senior research analyst for Thomson Reuters' Lipper research
    unit. "The market is kind of deciding what to do right now so I
    think it is going to be this way for a bit before it settles
    down."
        Late on Thursday, President Donald Trump said that he
    instructed U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to
    consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China after the
    country's state media said it would win any trade war.
    
        Major companies start to report quarterly earnings this
    month, with investors expecting strong profit growth. Wall
    Street analysts expect first-quarter S&P; 500 profits to
    rise by 18 percent over the year before, helped by the tax cuts
    passed in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
        International stock funds remain a relative bright spot,
    with emerging markets-focused funds taking in $636 million
    during the week and continuing an unbroken streak of weekly
    inflows this year, Lipper said.
        Taxable bond funds attracted $3.5 billion during the week
    ended Wednesday, Lipper data showed. Treasury funds took in $3.1
    billion, the most since January 2016.
        The following is a breakdown of the flows for the week,
