# EMERGING MARKETS-Mexico peso slips despite global risk appetite
    
        By Bruno Federowski
        BRASILIA, July 9 (Reuters) - The Mexican peso weakened on
    Monday after booking its best week in nearly seven years,
    extending a trend of volatility in the wake of leftist Andres
    Manuel Lopez Obrador's victory at the presidential elections
    this month.
        The peso fell 0.4 percent, contradicting strength
    in other emerging market currencies as concerns of a full-blown
    U.S.-China trade war, which hammered demand for risky assets in
    recent weeks, faded.
        The peso went through a seesaw after Obrador's victory,
    plummeting initially due to concerns over his nationalist track
    record but bouncing back as he and his advisors sought to
    assuage investors' angst.
        The peso ended last week 4.4 percent stronger, its largest
    weekly gain since October 2011. 
        Most Latin American stock markets rose as risk appetite
    recovered. MSCI's Latin American index was up
    1.1 percent, largely in line with a 1.4 percent with MSCI's
    wider emerging-market index.
        Brazil's stock market, the largest in the region, was closed
    for a local holiday in SÃ£o Paulo. Trading in the Brazilian real
     was largely subdued as the holiday kept future markets
    closed.
