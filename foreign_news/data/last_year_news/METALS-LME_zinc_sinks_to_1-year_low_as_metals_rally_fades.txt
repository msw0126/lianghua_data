# METALS-LME zinc sinks to 1-year low as metals rally fades
    
     (Recasts; updates prices)
        BEIJING, July 10 (Reuters) - London copper gave up early
    gains to trade lower on Tuesday, while zinc slumped to its
    lowest in more than a year, as a metals rally driven by
    investors looking for bargains after a trade war-fuelled
    sell-off appeared to run out of steam.
        The United States on Friday slapped tariffs on $34 billion
    of goods from top metals consumer China, which responded in
    kind. Fears that the trade spat could dampen demand for
    industrial metals had weighed on prices.
        Zinc was one of the worst hit metals, falling by 4.2 percent
    in London and above 5.3 percent in Shanghai last week, with the
    declines continuing on Tuesday.
        "A lot of zinc concentrate is coming on line from mines
    across the world," this year, said Helen Lau, an analyst at
    Argonaut Securities in Hong Kong, adding that demand for zinc in
    steel galvanising in China was seeing "a bit of a slowdown."
