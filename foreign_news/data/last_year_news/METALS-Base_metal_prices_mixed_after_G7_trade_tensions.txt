# METALS-Base metal prices mixed after G7 trade tensions
    
     (Adds broker comment, updates prices)
        BEIJING, June 11 (Reuters) - Base metal prices were mixed on
    Monday as positive sentiment over strong import data in China,
    the world's biggest metals consumer, was tempered by renewed
    fears of a global trade war amid a lack of consensus at the G7
    summit in Canada.
        China's unwrought copper imports in May reached their
    highest monthly total since December 2016, according to customs
    data released on Friday.
        London copper had touched a 4-1/2-year high on Thursday on
    concerns over a possible strike at the Escondida mine in Chile.
    However, the metal prices slipped in the next session and traded
    lower for a second straight day on Monday. 
        Malcolm Freeman, CEO of Kingdom Futures, wrote in a note
    that has been "no real follow-through" since funds piled into
    copper last week, "and the danger is signals will weaken again
    and everyone could get back out as quickly as they got in". 
          
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded August copper contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 0.2 percent at 54,220
    yuan ($8,465.66) a tonne by the mid-session interval, trading
    higher for a seventh day.
        * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal
    Exchange was down 0.2 percent at $7,295.50 a tonne, by
    0456 GMT, but was still within a striking distance of the recent
    high of $7,348.
        * ESCONDIDA: The union at BHP's Escondida
    copper mine in Chile said on Friday it saw a "favourable
    scenario" for reaching a deal on a new labour contract with the
    company, citing higher copper prices.
        * TARIFFS: Europe will implement counter-measures against
    U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium just like Canada, German
    Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday, voicing regret about
    President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw support for
    a G7 communique.
        * RUSAL: Rusal's exports and finances will take another hit
    if Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska is unable to persuade
    Washington to lift sanctions on the aluminium producer by late
    August, three industry sources said.

    regional tensions, while investors also started to focus on key
    central bank meetings later this week.
