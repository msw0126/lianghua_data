# METALS-Copper picks up from near 1-year low; nickel surges
    
     (Adds Shanghai closing prices, updates London prices)
        MELBOURNE/BEIJING, July 12 (Reuters) - London copper
    shrugged off an early dip to trade higher on Thursday, while
    nickel jumped as much as 3.8 percent as base metals staged a
    fragile recovery from the recent trade war-driven sell-off.
        Heavy losses in the previous session had pushed London Metal
    Exchange (LME) copper to its weakest in an almost a year as
    trade tensions between the United States and China undermined
    confidence in demand for metals. 
        "For now, prices have corrected as they take their lead from
    the global equity markets that have rallied off their lows but
    the metals volumes are thin," Malcolm Freeman, CEO of Kingdom
    Futures, wrote in a note.
        The bounce "appears to be no more than a correction ... with
    the possibility of more falls being ever present," he cautioned.
       
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME COPPER: Three-month LME copper was up 0.8
    percent at $6,194.50 a tonne, as of 0711 GMT, following steep
    losses in the previous session when prices hit $6,081 a tonne,
    the weakest since July 25, 2017. 
        * SHFE COPPER: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper
    closed up 1.3 percent at 49,000 yuan ($7,341.15) a tonne, above
    a one-year low of 48,390 yuan a tonne struck on Wednesday. 
        * NICKEL: Nickel was the biggest gainer in the base metals
    complex, climbing as much as 3.8 percent to $14,410 a tonne in
    London, its highest in a week, while Shanghai nickel
     closed 3.6 percent higher.
        * TRADE: China accused the United States of bullying and
    warned it would hit back after the Trump administration raised
    the stakes in their trade dispute, threatening 10 percent
    tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods in a move that rattled
    global markets.
        * FREEPORT: The Indonesian government is expected on
    Thursday to announce the details of a deal to acquire a majority
    stake in the local unit of U.S. copper miner Freeport McMoRan
    Inc, a source with knowledge of the matter said. 
    
        * GLENCORE: Glencore Plc faces at least two
    lawsuits by U.S. shareholders accusing the big Anglo-Swiss
    mining company of having made false and misleading disclosures
    before it received a subpoena in a corruption probe, and its
    stock tumbled.
