        NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors are
    starting to show doubt about emerging markets, pulling the most
    cash in more than 18 months from stocks in those regions,
    according to Lipper data on Thursday.
        Nearly $1.2 billion left emerging market stock mutual funds
    and exchange-traded funds during the seven days through May 30,
    according to the research service. That is the largest
    withdrawal since November 2016.
        Emerging markets face a host of challenges, including the
    rising U.S. dollar that makes debt denominated in the currency
    more expensive to repay, rising rates due to Federal Reserve
    policy in the United States, higher oil prices and the potential
    for a trade war.
        Canada and Mexico retaliated against the United States'
    decision on Thursday to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum
    imports and the European Union had its own reprisals ready to
    go.
        The Trump administration has also demanded that China make
    concessions for allegedly stealing U.S. technology by imposing
    tariffs on $50 billion of imports from that country. U.S.
    Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross heads to Beijing on Friday where
    he will attempt to get deals to export more U.S. goods.
        "The challenges for emerging markets have been multiplying,"
    an analyst for the Institute of International Finance wrote in a
    note on Thursday that highlighted a possible risk of "contagion"
    spreading from countries already facing currency devaluations,
    such as Turkey and Argentina, to other regions that have gulped
    down large foreign investments in recent years.
        An MSCI index that tracks 25 emerging market
    currencies against the U.S. dollar is more than 3 percent off
    record highs earlier this year. A comparable index that tracks
    the stocks in those markets is down more than 11
    percent from its highs this year in January.
        Fed Governor Lael Brainard said in a speech on Thursday that
    emerging markets may face "more challenging" conditions.
    
        "An environment with a strengthening dollar, rising energy
    prices, and the possibility of rising rates raises the risks of
    capital flow reversals in some emerging markets that have seen
    increased borrowing from abroad," she said.
        "Although stresses have been contained to a few vulnerable
    countries so far, the risk of a broader pullback bears
    watching."
        The following is a breakdown of the flows for the week,
    including mutual funds and ETFs:
