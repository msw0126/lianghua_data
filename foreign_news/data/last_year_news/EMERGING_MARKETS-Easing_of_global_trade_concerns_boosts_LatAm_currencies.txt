# EMERGING MARKETS-Easing of global trade concerns boosts LatAm currencies

        SAO PAULO, March 26 (Reuters) - Latin American currencies
    strengthened on Monday on growing optimism that the United
    States and China will soon begin negotiations on trade, easing
    fears of a global trade war.
        The move tracked a surge in global appetite for high-risk
    assets in the wake of a Wall Street Journal report that U.S.
    Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was considering a visit to
    Beijing to begin negotiations.
        Currencies in Latin America followed along, with Mexico's
    peso hitting a six-month high against the U.S. dollar
    on hopes that the United States could also strike a more
    constructive tone in negotiations over the North American Free
    Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Mexican peso closed the session up
    more than 1 percent, while the Brazilian real gained nearly 0.5
    percent. 
        "The market believes that the so-called trade war is all
    bark and no bite," economists at Continuum Economics wrote in a
    client note. "The mood regarding NAFTA should brighten again."
        However, analysts also warned that significant advances will
    be necessary in the eighth round of NAFTA talks scheduled for
    April for the peso to hold its gains.         
        Mexico's S&P;/BMV IPC stock index rose 0.74 percent, largely
    pushed by retail giant Wal-Mart de Mexico, whose
    shares rose nearly 3 percent.        
        Brazil's Bovespa climbed nearly 1 percent. Miners
    and steelmakers ranked among the largest gainers, with Brazil's
    Gerdau SA and Usinas Sider√∫rgicas de Minas Gerais SA
     both rising. Shares in mining giant Vale <VALE3.SA
    increased nearly 1 percent despite a decline in China-listed
    iron ore futures, largely boosting the index.
