        NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields declined
    on Wednesday as quarter-end buying for portfolio rebalancing and
    safe-haven demand due to growing stock market losses pushed the
    benchmark 10-year yield to seven-week lows.
        These factors overshadowed this week's record high $294
    billion in government debt, to be completed Wednesday with sales
    of $15 billion in two-year floating-rate notes and $29 billion
    seven-year notes.
        The $14.6 trillion bond sector, which investors now favor
    overs stocks, has produced a 0.68 percent total return in March
    for its strongest month since last August, according to an index
    compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays. 
        "We are seeing a strong bid this week, reflecting a
    flight-to-quality demand," said Bill Merz, head of fixed income
    research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "It's
    been exacerbated by short-covering."
        Traders have exited short positions or bets on bond yields
    to rise this week as U.S. stock prices fell on worries about a
    trade war between the United States and China and a scandal over
    political consultants accessing Facebook user data.
    
        Speculators had heavy net short positions in Treasury
    futures with near record net shorts in five-year T-notes,
    according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
    released last Friday.
        At 11:19 a.m. (1519 GMT), the yield on 10-year Treasury
    notes was down 3.5 basis points to 2.753 percent. It
    hit a seven-week low of 2.743 percent earlier.
        The yield on five-year Treasury notes reached a
    six-week low of 2.540 percent earlier Wednesday. It was last
    down 2.8 basis points at 2.564 percent. 
        Wall Street's three major indexes were down for a second
    day, on track for their biggest monthly loss since January 2016.
    
        On the data front, the government revised up its reading on
    domestic economic growth in the fourth quarter to 1.9 percent
    from 2.5 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast an
    adjustment up to 2.7 percent.
