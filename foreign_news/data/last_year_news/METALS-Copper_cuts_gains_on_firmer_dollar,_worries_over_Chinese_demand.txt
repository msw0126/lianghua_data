        MANILA, May 17 (Reuters) - London copper futures pared gains
    on Thursday as the U.S. dollar hovered near a five-month high
    against the euro and amid worries over slower demand in top
    copper user China.
        Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was
    up 0.3 percent at $6,844.50 a tonne by 0714 GMT, off a
    session-high of $6,866.
        ANZ analysts said in a note that the copper market appeared
    to be tightening, with the front-end of the curve moving into
    backwardation, when prices for future delivery are lower than
    those for immediate dispatch.
        The one-day spread on tomorrow's contracts, or tom-next
    spread, stood at $50 per tonne. "This appears to be creating a
    short squeeze, with many traders forced to buy back short
    positions," ANZ said.
        "If you look at the longer term, there's definitely a bull
    case for copper," Argonaut Securities analyst Helen Lau said,
    citing declining ore grades and rising cost, among other
    factors.
        "But in the short-term, we still need to grapple with
    slowing copper demand from China especially in the power
    sector."
        
        DOLLAR: The euro stayed near a five-month low against the
    greenback on concerns political developments in Italy could
    cause wider disruptions in the euro bloc, making
    dollar-denominated assets more costly for holders of other
    currencies.
        SHANGHAI COPPER: The most-traded July copper contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange closed up 0.2 percent at
    51,050 yuan ($8,023) a tonne.
        BULL CYCLE: Metals markets are moving into a new bull cycle
    that will be longer and shallower than the last, driven by
    rising inflation and dispersed demand growth, panelists said at
    the LME week Asia conference in Hong Kong.
        CHALCO: Aluminum Corp of China Ltd, or Chalco, plans to
    export 30,000-50,000 tonnes of alumina in May, the company's
    president said.
        U.S.-CHINA: The United States and China launch trade talks
    on Thursday in a bid to avert a damaging tariff war, with the
    White House's harshest China critic relegated to a supporting
    role, senior Trump administration officials said.
        HONG KONG EXCHANGE: The head of Hong Kong Exchanges and
    Clearing said it would take time for the group to
    develop its metals business on the Chinese mainland, including
    plans to develop its commodity business in Qianhai in southern
    China and start warehousing through its London Metal Exchange
    operations.
        LITHIUM: Australia's Kidman Resources said it would
    supply lithium for Tesla Inc's electric car batteries,
    the latest in a string of deals by carmakers securing supplies
    of the mineral as demand surges for clean cars.
        OTHER METALS: LME aluminium rose 0.4 percent to
    $2,325 a tonne and nickel was flat at $14,475. In
    Shanghai, aluminium climbed 1 percent to end at 14,885
    yuan per tonne, while nickel added 0.4 percent to 107,820 yuan.
