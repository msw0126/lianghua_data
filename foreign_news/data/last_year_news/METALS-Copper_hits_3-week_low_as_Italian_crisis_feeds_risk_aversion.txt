# METALS-Copper hits 3-week low as Italian crisis feeds risk aversion
    
     (Updates prices)
        By Manolo Serapio Jr
        MANILA, May 30 (Reuters) - London copper fell more than 1
    percent to a three-week low on Wednesday, pressured by a firmer
    dollar and as Italy's deepening political crisis pulled
    investors out of risky assets.
        Along with copper, investors also sold off other commodities
    from oil to grains as well as equities as Italy, Europe's
    third-biggest economy, may call elections that could put leaders
    in power who question the country's commitment to the European
    Union and the euro currency. 
        "Markets worry that the upcoming election will ultimately
    resemble a referendum on the euro ... resulting in an
    existential crisis for the euro zone," Mizuho Bank said in a
    note.
        Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was
    down 1.5 percent at $6,754.50 a tonne, as of 0702 GMT. Earlier
    in the session, it hit $6,750.50, its weakest since May 8.
        Renewed trade tensions between the United States and China
    also weighed on sentiment, after Beijing slammed Washington's
    unexpected statement that it will press ahead with tariffs and
    restrictions on investments by Chinese companies.
            
        * SHANGHAI COPPER: The most-traded July copper contract on
    the Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped 1.5 percent to
    close at the day's bottom of 50,780 yuan a tonne, a two-week
    low.
        * EURO: The dollar hovered near a 10-month high versus the
    euro as Italy's political crisis raised the likelihood of an
    early election. A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated
    assets costlier for holders of other currencies.
        * CHINA RESPONSE: China said it was ready to fight back if
    the United States was looking to ignite a trade war, after
    Washington said it can still go ahead in imposing tariffs on $50
    billion of imports from China unless Beijing addresses the issue
    of theft of American intellectual property. 
        * INDIA SMELTER: Vedanta Resources is working on a
    legal challenge to an Indian state's closure of one of its
    copper smelters, but it will not proceed until tensions over the
    deaths of 13 people during protests last week have eased. 
    
        * COPPER SUPPORT: The absence of the Indian smelter cuts 1.7
    percent of global copper supply and should support copper prices
    in the short term, said Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst
    Vivek Dhar.
        "The smelter accounts for about 50 percent of India's copper
    output and the smelter's closure will importantly mean that
    India will need to import copper to meet domestic demand, Dhar
    said in a note.      
        * ALUMINIUM PREMIUMS: Two global aluminium producers have
    offered Japanese buyers a premium of $159 to $160 per tonne for
    primary metal shipments for the July to September quarter, up
    between 23 percent and 24 percent from the current quarter, four
    sources directly involved in pricing talks said.
        * TIN: Shanghai tin settled 0.3 percent higher at
    153,300 yuan a tonne, but well off the day's peak of 157,560
    yuan, its loftiest since August, following a nearly
    uninterrupted rally that began last week.
        * OTHER METALS: LME zinc fell 1.1 percent to $3,056
    a tonne and nickel dropped 0.9 percent to $14,765, both
    retreating after Tuesday's advance. 
        "Looking ahead, the increase in smelting capacity in China
    and the reduction of auto import tariff in China are the
    headwinds to zinc prices in our view," said Argonaut Securities
    analyst Helen Lau. 
        * MARKETS: Asian shares extended a global selloff as Italy's
    political crisis provoked a heavy retreat on Wall Street and
    pushed up borrowing costs for the government in Rome.
