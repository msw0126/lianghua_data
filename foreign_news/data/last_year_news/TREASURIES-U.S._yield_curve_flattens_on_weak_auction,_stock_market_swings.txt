        NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - The margin between short- and
    long-dated U.S. Treasury yields shrank on Wednesday as
    quarter-end buying for portfolio rebalancing and safe-haven
    demand due to growing stock market losses pushed the benchmark
    10-year yield to seven-week lows.
        On the other hand, weak demand at a $29 billion auction of
    seven-year notes, the final leg of this week's record high $294
    billion in government debt supply, propelled shorter maturity
    yields higher.
        "It wasn't a great auction," said James Ong, senior macro
    strategist at Invesco in Atlanta. "But I wouldn't read too much
    into one auction."
        All the other Treasuries auctions this week were met with
    average demand, according to analysts. 
        The $14.6 trillion bond sector, which investors now favor
    over stocks, has produced a 0.68 percent total return in March
    for its strongest month since last August, according to an index
    compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays. 
        "We are seeing a strong bid this week, reflecting a
    flight-to-quality demand," said Bill Merz, head of fixed income
    research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. "It's
    been exacerbated by short-covering."
        This week traders have exited short positions or bets on
    bond yields to rise as U.S. stock prices fell on worries about a
    trade war between the United States and China and a scandal over
    political consultants accessing Facebook user data.
    
        Speculators had heavy net short positions in Treasury
    futures with near record net shorts in five-year T-notes,
    according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
    released last Friday.
        The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 1.5
    basis points at 2.773 percent. It hit a seven-week low of 2.743
    percent earlier.
        Two-year Treasury yields were up 0.4 basis point 
    at 2.282 percent. 
        The spread between two-year and 30-year yields
     contracted to 72 basis points, its tightest level
    since September 2007, Tradeweb and Reuters data showed.
        Wall Street's three major indexes were down for a second
    day, on track for their biggest monthly loss since January 2016.
    
        Given this week's stock market volatility, bond yields will
    likely test lower levels ahead of a three-day weekend, Invesco's
    Ong said.
        The U.S. bond market will close early at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT)
    on Thursday and shut for the Good Friday holiday.    
        On the data front, the government revised up its reading on
    domestic economic growth in the fourth quarter to 2.9 percent
    from 2.5 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast an
    adjustment higher to 2.7 percent.
