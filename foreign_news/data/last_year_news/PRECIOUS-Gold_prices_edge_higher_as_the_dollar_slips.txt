# PRECIOUS-Gold prices edge higher as the dollar slips
    
        BENGALURU, May 31 (Reuters) - Gold prices edged up early on
    Thursday, as the dollar eased from 6-1/2 month highs hit earlier
    this week on a weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data, with
    prices further supported by concerns about the trade war.
       
        FUNDAMENTALS  
        * Spot gold        rose 0.2 percent to $1,303.30 per ounce
    by 0053 GMT.

        * The dollar index       , which measures the greenback
    against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.1 percent to

        * U.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially
    thought in the first quarter as consumer spending rose at its
    weakest pace in nearly five years.             
        * China lashed out on Wednesday at renewed threats from the
    White House on trade, warning that it was ready to fight back if
    Washington was looking for a trade war.             
        * The United States will announce plans to impose tariffs on
    steel and aluminium from the European Union, possibly as early
    as Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday,
    citing people familiar with the matter.             
        * Italy's two main anti-establishment parties could yet form

    able to steer the country out of deadlock.             
        * A senior North Korean official made a rare visit to the
    United States on Wednesday for talks about a possible summit

        * South Africa's Gold Fields          is setting aside
    pursuit of new acquisitions for a year as it focuses on its
    existing operations and nearby prospects instead, the bullion
    producer's chief executive told Reuters late on Tuesday.
                
        * Gold mining giants in Ghana such as Newmont        , Gold
