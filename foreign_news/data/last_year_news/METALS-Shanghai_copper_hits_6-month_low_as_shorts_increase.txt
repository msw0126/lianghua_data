# METALS-Shanghai copper hits 6-month low as shorts increase
    
     (Updates position data, prices)
        BEIJING, March 21 (Reuters) - Shanghai copper prices fell
    for a fourth day on Wednesday, marking their lowest close in
    almost six months amid fears of a trade war as investors waited
    for news on a U.S. interest rate hike. 
        Short positions held by brokerages on the most traded May
    copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) rose by
    almost 3,000 lots to 104,540 lots on Wednesday and now exceed
    long positions by more than 18,000 lots, ShFE data show.
        Markets are waiting to take their cue from the Federal
    Reserve's decision on interest rates later in the day, Malcolm
    Freeman, CEO of Kingdom Futures, wrote in a note. 
        Higher U.S. rates may support a rising dollar, which would
    limit demand for dollar-denominated commodities such as copper
    from buyers paying with other currencies.
        "Aside from this there is also the growing paranoia around
    the possibility of a global trade war which appears in balance
    to be frightening the more speculative investors away from the
    sector," Freeman added.

    dipped to 2.009 million tonnes in February from a revised 2.221
