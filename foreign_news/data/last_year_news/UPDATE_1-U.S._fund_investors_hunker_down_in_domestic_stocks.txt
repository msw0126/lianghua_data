# UPDATE 1-U.S. fund investors hunker down in domestic stocks

        NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors streamed
    into U.S. stocks for a second straight week, according to Lipper
    data on Thursday, betting that domestic equities can dodge the
    threat of a retaliatory trade war and economic-slowdown risks.
        Equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) took in
    $3.7 billion during the seven-day stretch that ended May 23,
    while their taxable-bond counterparts attracted $3.1 billion,
    the research service said. Nine in 10 dollars that went into
    stocks moved into funds primarily invested within the United
    States.
        The inflows into stocks and bonds supported a market being
    blown many different directions by rising rates, trade conflict
    and other geopolitical crosscurrents even as corporate earnings
    strengthen.
        "I was pretty amazed by the numbers," said Tom Roseen, head
    of research services for Thomson Reuters' Lipper unit, noting
    the rise since April in both oil prices and U.S. bond yields,
    though both assets have eased a bit off their highs.
        "We still have headwinds as far as global markets go and
    that could dampen global growth."
        Small-cap funds, seen as less influenced by global economic
    factors as by domestic demand and corporate tax cuts, pulled in
    $2.6 billion, the most since April 2017.
        Global equities in 47 countries measured by MSCI Inc
     have returned just over 1 percent this year as the U.S.
    feuds with China over trade and North Korea over nuclear
    weapons.
        Emerging market currencies sank on economic concerns in
    Argentina and Turkey, while Italian government bond yields
    soared on fears the government could shred euro zone unity.
        Softening the blow, Roseen said, were notes from the U.S.
    Federal Reserve's May 1-2 meeting released on Wednesday that
    showed policymakers were still ready to raise rates but seeing
    limited signs that inflation has already gotten out of hand.
    
        The march higher in yields, which pushes bond prices lower,
    has done little to hurt demand for funds invested in those
    bonds. Corporate investment-grade debt funds, for instance, took
    in their 11th straight week of cash.
        Higher yields did help bank sector funds pull in $330
    million, while debt-sensitive real estate sector funds posted
    $334 million in withdrawals.
        Strong oil prices helped energy stock funds draw $560
    million in new cash, the most since January. And healthcare
    funds posted $533 million just one week after their largest
    inflows of the year after a policy speech by U.S. President
    Donald Trump on drug prices.
        The following is a breakdown of the flows for the week,
    including mutual funds and ETFs:
     Sector                    Flow Chg  % Assets  Assets     Count
