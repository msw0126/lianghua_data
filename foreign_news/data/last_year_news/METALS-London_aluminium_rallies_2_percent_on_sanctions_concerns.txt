# METALS-London aluminium rallies 2 percent on sanctions concerns
    
        MELBOURNE, April 9 (Reuters) - London aluminium rallied two
    percent on Monday and is expected to rise further on concerns
    that sanctions by the United States on aluminium giant Rusal
     could hamper trade in some seven percent of the
    world's annual supply of the metal. 
        The United States on Friday imposed sanctions against
    Russian businessmen, companies and government officials,
    striking at associates of President Vladimir Putin in one of
    Washington's most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for a range
    of activities.
        Shares of United Company Rusal Plc fell 31 percent
    in Hong Kong on Monday after it was included in the new list.
    
        "Market concerns have that the sanction against Rusal and
    its own technical default assessment may lead to supply shortage
    in both aluminium and alumina," said Hong Kong broker Argonaut
    in a report.
        Rusal produced some 3.7 million tonnes of aluminium in 2017,
    about 7 percent of the world's total, Argonaut said. Its annual
    alumina production of 11.5 million tonnes was also about 7
    percent of the global total, while it produced about 4 percent
    of the world's bauxite, the broker said.
        "It is expected that (the aluminium price rise) will
    extend further," Argonaut said.
