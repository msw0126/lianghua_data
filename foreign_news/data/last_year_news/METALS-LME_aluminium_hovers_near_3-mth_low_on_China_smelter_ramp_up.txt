# METALS-LME aluminium hovers near 3-mth low on China smelter ramp up
    
     (Updates prices)
        MELBOURNE, March 15 (Reuters) - London aluminium hovered
    near its lowest since late December on Thursday on expectations
    of rising supply as China's winter pollution controls expire.
        More generally, metal prices came under light pressure amid
    mounting investor concerns that growing trade tensions would
    hurt the global economy.
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LONDON ALUMINIUM: London Metal Exchange aluminium
    was trading flat at $2,089 a tonne by 0728 GMT, having slipped
    to its weakest since Dec. 19 at $2,087 on Wednesday. Support is
    seen at the 200-day moving average at $2,083, a break of which
    could trigger a steeper correction, as it would send a sell
    signal to momentum following funds.
        * SHANGHAI ALUMINIUM: Shanghai aluminium hit its
    lowest in 14 months at 13,820 yuan ($2,191) on Tuesday and last
    traded at 13,990 yuan.
        * HEATING SEASON ENDS: China's winter heating season ended
    on Thursday. Aluminium smelters in 28 northern Chinese cities
    had been told to reduce output by at least 30 percent from Nov.
    15 to March 15, although the actual volume cut was below
    expectations, putting pressure on prices.
        * OUTPUT: China's aluminium production fell 1.8 percent in
    January-February from a year earlier, as the country's pollution
    crackdown and supply-side reform kicked in. An estimated 4.4
    million tonnes of new capacity are expected to be completed this
    year. 
        "Although the (Chinese) figures show that aluminium
    production decreased year-on-year ... it reached over 90,000
    tons on a daily basis â€“ the highest level since last June," said
    Commerzbank.
          "Stocks of both steel and aluminium have grown noticeably
    so far this year, which points to subdued demand and could give
    rise to concerns about excessive supply." 
        * STOCKS: ShFE aluminium AL-STX-SGH stockpiles held at
    exchange warehouses are within a whisker of record highs near
    850,000 tonnes, reflecting a surplus of domestic material. 
        * DISCOUNT: The discount between cash ShFE aluminium
    and physical prices AL-A00-CCNMM has narrowed to 35 yuan from
    385 three weeks ago, reflecting a tightening market and an
    expected pick-up in nearby demand. 
        * COPPER: LME copper slipped 0.4 percent to $6,960 a
    tonne, paring previous session's gains. Prices are expected to
    rise as industrial production in the seasonally strongest second
    quarter ramps up.
        * TRADE: The Trump administration is pressing China to cut
    its trade surplus with the United States by $100 billion.
    
        * COBALT: Glencore, the world's biggest producer of
    cobalt, has agreed to sell around a third of its cobalt
    production over the next three years to Chinese battery recycler
    GEM.
        * SMOG: Eastern China's Jiangsu province will step up its
    war on pollution and focus on "high-quality development"
    following a spike in smog early this year.
        * DOLLAR: Supporting metals, the dollar fell against the yen
    on Thursday as lingering worries about global trade tensions
    weighed on investors' risk appetite.
