# METALS-Copper recovers from three-week low as China eyes policy support
    
        MANILA, June 21 (Reuters) - London copper rebounded from a
    three-week low on Thursday after China said it was eyeing cuts
    in banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) and other measures to
    spur economic growth, which could support copper demand in the
    world's top user.
        China's state radio quoted a cabinet meeting as saying on
    Wednesday that Beijing will use targeted reduction in RRR and
    other monetary policy tools to boost credit support for small
    firms and keep economic growth steady.
        Fears of a full-blown trade war with the United States have
    magnified concerns about the outlook for the world's
    second-largest economy, following weaker-than-expected growth
    data for May.
        Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was
    up 0.9 percent at $6,836 a tonne by 0128 GMT, recovering from
    Wednesday's low of $6,772, its weakest since May 30. On the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange, the most-traded August copper
    contract gained 0.3 percent to 51,970 yuan ($8,031) a
    tonne.
        
        * COPPER SURPLUS: The global world refined copper market
    showed a 55,000 tonnes surplus in March, compared with a 87,000
    tonnes surplus in February, the International Copper Study Group
    said.
        * VEDANTA LEAK: Vedanta Ltd said a sulphuric acid
    leak from a tank at its southern Indian copper smelter was
    severe and inaction could lead to serious environmental
    consequences.
        * EU TARIFFS: The European Union will begin charging import
    duties of 25 percent on a range of U.S. products on Friday, in
    response to U.S tariffs imposed on EU steel and aluminium early
    this month, the European Commission said.
        * U.S. PROBE: The U.S. Commerce Department is investigating
    recent steel price hikes to determine whether some market
    participants are "illegitimately profiteering" from new tariffs,
    Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.
        * ALUMINIUM OUTPUT: Global primary aluminium output in May
    rose to 5.441 million tonnes from a revised 5.303 million tonnes
    in April, International Aluminium Institute data showed.
    
        * RUSAL: Sanctions-hit Russian aluminium producer Rusal
     restarted production at its Friguia alumina refinery
    in Guinea on Wednesday after a six-year pause, the West African
    country's mines minister said.
        * U.S. DATA: U.S. home sales unexpectedly fell for the
    second straight month in May as an acute shortage of properties
    on the market pushed house prices to a record high.
        * MARKETS: The dollar hovered near an 11-month high against
    a basket of currencies, supported by a rise in U.S. yields,
    while Asian shares were subdued.
