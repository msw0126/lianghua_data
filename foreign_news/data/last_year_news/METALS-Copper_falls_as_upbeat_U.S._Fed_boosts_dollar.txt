        LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - Copper prices edged lower on
    Tuesday along with aluminium and nickel, pushed down by a
    stronger dollar and fears that demand will be damaged by a
    global trade war and weaker economic growth in top consumer
    China.
        Benchmark copper         on the London Metal Exchange (LME)
    closed 0.7 percent down at $6,152 a tonne, near a one-year low
    of $6,081 reached on July 11 and down about 16 percent from
    early June.
        Nickel and aluminium were at or near their lowest since
    April and zinc was close to a one-year nadir. 
        Negative sentiment was pushing down prices despite good
    supply and demand fundamentals, said Societe Generale analyst
    Robin Bhar. 
        "Every rally is being sold into," he said. "It's not clear
    whether we have bottomed out or if there's another 10 percent on
    the downside."
        
        DOLLAR: The stronger dollar pressured metals by making them
    more expensive for users of other currencies.              
        FED: Upbeat comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome
    Powell on Tuesday signalled that the U.S. central bank will move
    ahead with interest rate rises, which are likely to boost the
    dollar further.             
        U.S. FACTORIES: Also supporting the greenback was U.S. data
    showing a sharp rebound in manufacturing and gains in mining
    output that boosted industrial production in June.             
        CHINA ECONOMY: Following data on Monday showing slightly
    slower growth for the second quarter in China, the country's
    state planning agency said that a 2018 economic growth target of
    about 6.5 percent remains achievable. 
        China is the world's biggest consumer of metals. Monday's
    data also showed the weakest expansion in factory activity for
    two years in June.                          
        TRADE WAR: China said on Monday that it had filed a
    complaint to the World Trade Organization about Washington's
    proposed tariff list on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.
                
        COPPER STOCKS: On-warrant copper inventories available to
    the market in LME-registered warehouses rose 4,175 tonnes to
    225,975 tonnes, the highest in a month. MCUSTX-TOTAL
        COPPER SPREAD: The discount of cash copper to the
    three-month contract has also grown from around zero at the
    start of July to $36, signalling greater availability of metal. 
        ALUMINIUM: LME aluminium ended 1.1 percent lower at $2,032 a
    tonne after touching $2,021.50 on Friday, the lowest since April
    6 and down nearly 15 percent from early June. 
        NICKEL: Nickel         finished down 1.3 percent at $13,490
    a tonne after hitting its lowest since April 12 at $13,475.
        OTHER METALS: Zinc         ended 1.5 percent up at $2,512 a
    tonne, retracing some of its losses on Monday, while lead
            closed 0.4 percent down at $2,166 a tonne and tin
            was bid flat at $19,500 a tonne.
