# EMERGING MARKETS-Colombia peso rebounds to 3-yr high as crude rises
    
     (Updates prices)
        By Bruno Federowski
        BRASILIA, April 3 (Reuters) - The Colombian peso on Tuesday
    followed crude prices to a nearly three-year high, rebounding
    from the previous day's selloff.
        Still, the mood across global financial markets was cautious
    as concerns over a United States-China trade war
    lingered.
        The peso firmed nearly 1.2 percent to 2,773.8 to the
    dollar, leading gains among Latin American currencies and
    recovering from a 0.6 percent drop the day before.
        The rebound was largely underpinned by an upswing in oil
    prices, which had posted their biggest one-day fall in almost a
    year the day before.
        China announced last week it would slap extra tariffs on 128
    U.S. products, deepening a dispute between the world's two
    biggest economies and triggering a selloff in risky assets.
        Currencies were mostly stronger, while stock markets
    throughout the region traded higher.
        Mexico's peso and stock exchange both strengthened on
    optimism about the prospects of modernizing the North American
    Free Trade Agreement. 
        Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index was up 0.6
    percent, as shares of Vale SA extended their recent
    rally in the wake of a new dividend policy. State-controlled oil
    company Petr√≥leo Brasileiro SA also rose, supported
    by the advance in crude futures.
