        MANILA, May 23 (Reuters) - London copper futures edged lower
    on Wednesday, pulling back from the previous session's nearly
    one-month peak, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was
    not pleased with recent trade talks between the United States
    and China.
        His comments on Tuesday came after U.S. Treasury Secretary
    Steven Mnuchin said over the weekend that the two countries had
    put the prospect of a trade war "on hold" while they work on a
    wider trade agreement, which helped revive appetite for riskier
    assets.
        "The shifting sands of trade talks between U.S. and China is
    likely to see commodities remain volatile," ANZ analysts said in
    a note.
        Except for tin, all London metals and most in Shanghai fell
    as "Asian long liquidation and speculative selling was the
    dominant theme," said Matt France, head of institutional sales
    for Asia metals at Marex Spectron.
             
        COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange
     was down 0.7 percent at $6,927.50 a tonne by 0708 GMT,
    after peaking at $6,999 on Tuesday, its loftiest since April 26.
    In Shanghai, the most-traded July copper contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange tracked overnight gains in
    London, closing up 0.6 percent at 51,770 yuan ($8,112) a tonne.
        GRASBERG: Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd said it was in
    discussions to sell its interest in the world's second largest
    copper mine to Indonesia's state mining holding company Inalum.
    
        LEAD: LME lead retreated from a 12-week high, down
    0.6 percent to $2,460 a tonne, after what analysts said was a
    rally driven by Chinese speculators on Tuesday as they bet on
    potential supply shortages. In Shanghai, lead slipped
    0.1 percent to 20,200 yuan per tonne, after hitting 20,465 yuan
    on Tuesday, its strongest since October 2017.
        NICKEL: LME nickel fell 0.7 percent to $14,670 a
    tonne after recent gains. Nickel remains the best performer
    among base metals, with a year-to-date gain of 15 percent.
        LME nickel stockpiles are the lowest since 2014, underlining
    a deficit in the metal used for stainless steel. "Sentiment has
    been buoyed by strong demand from the stainless steel sector, as
    well as growing demand from the electric vehicle market," ANZ
    analysts said. 
        NORTH KOREA TALKS: Trump said there was a "substantial
    chance" his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will not
    take place as planned on June 12 amid concerns that Kim is
    resistant to giving up his nuclear weapons.
        MARKETS: The dollar edged higher versus a basket of
    currencies ahead of the release of the minutes of the Federal
    Reserve's last policy meeting for hints on the pace of further
    U.S. monetary tightening.
