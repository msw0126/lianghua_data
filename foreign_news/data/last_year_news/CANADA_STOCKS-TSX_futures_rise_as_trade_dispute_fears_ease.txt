# CANADA STOCKS-TSX futures rise as trade dispute fears ease
April 10 (Reuters) - Futures pointed to a higher opening for Canada's main stock index on Tuesday as Chinese President Xi Jinping's promise to lower import tariffs eased concerns about a Sino-U.S. trade war. 
Xi said China will sharply widen market access for foreign investors, a chief complaint of the country's trading partners and a point of contention for U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which has threatened billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese goods.
