# METALS-Tariff-linked metals revive on hopes of partial exemptions
    
        MELBOURNE, March 8 (Reuters) - Metals at risk of a tariff on
    U.S. imports largely recovered from steep falls on Thursday
    after an official said certain key partners could be exempt from
    duties allaying concerns over demand. 
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * TARIFFS: Concerns that the U.S. could slap down import
    tariffs on steel, impacting zinc, used in galvanised steel and
    nickel, used in stainless steel, as well as aluminium have
    dragged those metals in the past week.
        * TRUMP: U.S. President Donald Trump plans to offer Canada
    and Mexico a 30-day exemption from planned tariffs on steel and
    aluminium imports, which could be extended based on progress in
    NAFTA talks, a White House official said on Wednesday night. 
    
        * PRICES: Prices of aluminium and zinc that
    were sold down on Wednesday recovered by more than half a
    percent. LME nickel slipped half a percent, having
    fallen less severely in the previous session. 
        * COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper traded flat
    at $6,947 a tonne by 0254 GMT, after falling 0.8 percent in the
    previous session. Shanghai Futures Exchange copper
    traded down 0.6 percent at 52,370 yuan ($8,275) a tonne. 
        * JAPAN ECONOMY: Japan's economy expanded more than
    initially estimated in October-December due to an upward
    revision of capital expenditure and inventory data, confirming
    an eighth consecutive quarter of growth.
        * DRC: Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila
    will soon sign into law a new mining code, the government and
    the country's mining companies said on Wednesday. The code has
    been vigorously opposed by the miners.
        * ERG: Debt-laden Kazakh miner Eurasian Resources Group
    (ERG) has revived efforts to sell its Frontier copper mine in
    Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) despite a drop in valuation
    to about $400 million, two banking sources said.
        * U.S. ECONOMY: When Donald Trump became president last year
    he vowed to make American manufacturing giants, such as
    Harley-Davidson and Caterpillar great again. But
    a year later, the two companies stand to take a hit from his
    policies.

    could include carve-outs for key partners.
