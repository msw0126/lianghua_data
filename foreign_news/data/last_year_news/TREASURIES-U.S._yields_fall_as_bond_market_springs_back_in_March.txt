        NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on
    Thursday, marking a comeback for the $14.6 trillion sector as
    investors piled into low-risk government bonds on worries about
    economic growth and a dramatic pullback in stock prices in
    March.
        The U.S. bond market will close early at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT)
    and shut for the Good Friday holiday. 
        Treasuries have generated a 0.72 percent total return in
    March for its best month since August, rebounding from losses in
    January and February. Still, they have produced a 0.11 percent
    loss in the first three months of 2018, according to an index
    compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays.
        "We are seeing some rotation out of equities into fixed
    income," said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency
    trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. in New York. "Some of this has
    to do with the pullback in stocks and some of it has to do with
    what's coming out of Washington."
        Wall Street has sagged on fears about a global trade war
    after U.S. President Donald Trump introduced tariffs against
    China and other nations for perceived unfair trade practices.
    Stock prices also tumbled on jitters about technology shares in
    the wake a scandal over political consultants accessing Facebook
     data on 50 million users.
        The S&P; 500 and Dow are on track for their worst quarter in
    more than two years.
        Safe-haven bids for bonds supported demand for $294 billion
    worth of Treasury bills and notes this week, a record amount,
    traders and analysts said.
        "We made it through some significant supply here," Milstein
    said.
        At 11:06 (1506 GMT), the yield on 10-year Treasury notes
     was down 1.8 basis points at 2.757 percent. It hit a
    seven-week low of 2.743 percent on Wednesday.
        For the month, the 10-year yield has fallen 11 basis points,
    its steepest decline since August. However, it has risen 35
    basis points for the quarter.
        The drop in longer-dated yields on Thursday flattened the
    yield curve to levels not seen in more than a decade.
        The spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields
     contracted to 46.70 basis points, the tightest
    level since September 2007, Tradeweb data showed.
        A flattening curve is a proxy on investors' concerns over
    slowing economic growth.
        The Chicago purchasing management index unexpectedly fell to
    a one-year trough in March
        On the other hand, the jobs market has remained solid with
    first-time filings for unemployment benefits hitting over a
    45-year low last week. Consumer spending rose a second straight
    month, while the University of Michigan said consumer confidence
    ended March at its strongest level in more than 14 years.
