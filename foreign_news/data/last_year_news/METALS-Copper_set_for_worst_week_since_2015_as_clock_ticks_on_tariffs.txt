# METALS-Copper set for worst week since 2015 as clock ticks on tariffs
    
        BEIJING, July 6 (Reuters) - London copper traded lower for a
    fifth session on Friday, hours before the United States imposes
    tariffs on $34 billion worth of goods from China, which has
    vowed to respond in a trade row that is expected to way on
    demand for industrial metals.
        Copper, seen as a bellwether for economic health, struck a
    fresh 11-month low in London, where it is down 4.9 percent so
    far this week, putting it on track for its steepest weekly drop
    since the week ending Nov. 20, 2015. 
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal
    Exchange slipped as much as 0.8 percent to $6,295 a
    tonne, its lowest since July 28, 2017. It has fallen for nine of
    the last 10 sessions.
        * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded August copper contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange fell as much as 1.2 percent
    to 49,010 yuan a tonne, the lowest since July 21, 2017. It is
    down 4.6 percent for the week, which would be its worst since
    September 2015.
        * ESCONDIDA: Negotiations between workers and BHP Billiton
    Plc, at the Escondida copper mine in Chile, the
    world's largest, are "far from reaching agreement" with less
    than three weeks to go before the negotiation deadline, a union
    official told Reuters on Thursday. {nL1N1U201Y]
        * TARIFFS: President Donald Trump said on Thursday the
    United States may ultimately impose tariffs on more than a
    half-trillion dollars' worth of Chinese goods as the world's two
    largest economies hurtled toward the start of a trade war.
    {nL4N1U11GF]
        * ZINC: Zinc fell 0.6 percent in Shanghai and
    London, where it hit a one-year low on Thursday amid
    rising supply. The metal is set for a drop of 5.6 percent in
    Shanghai and 5.9 percent in London this week, which would be its
    steepest weekly falls since December 2016 and April 2016,
    respectively.

        * Asian share markets were set for a bumpy ride on Friday

    investors fear it could trigger a full-blown global trade war.
