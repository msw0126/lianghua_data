# Investors dump $5 bln of equity funds on U.S.-China trade fight -ICI
    
        By James Thorne
        NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - U.S.-China trade tensions
    drove investors to pull $5.16 billion from equity
    exchange-traded funds and mutual funds in favor of bonds for the
    week ended June 20, the Investment Company Institute said on
    Wednesday.
        Cash outflows from equities were led by domestic long-term
    mutual funds, which ceded $3.11 billion after $1.15 billion the
    prior week. Equity ETFs had negative net outflows of $3.59
    billion, seven days after reporting $7.54 billion of inflows.
        "The risk off trade was clearly visible in last week's fund
    flows," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the
    West. "Uncertainty of trade protection is becoming a growing
    concern for investors as the U.S.-China trade war heats up."
        On June 15, both the United States and China released lists
    of imports to be targeted by tariffs.
        Total ETF and mutual fund bond flows stayed positive for the
    18th straight week, attracting $4.55 billion compared with $5.56
    billion a week earlier.
        Commodity fund investment declined $264 million as
    "investors scaled back expectations for emerging market growth,"
    Anderson said.
        Hybrid funds experienced withdrawals of $848 million.
        Demand for all funds was broadly negative at $1.72 billion,
    compared with inflows of $9.95 billion in the previous week.
        The following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual
    funds and ETFs (all figures in millions of dollars):
