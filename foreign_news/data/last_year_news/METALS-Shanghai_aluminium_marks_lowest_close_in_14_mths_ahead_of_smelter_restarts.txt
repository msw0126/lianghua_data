# METALS-Shanghai aluminium marks lowest close in 14 mths ahead of smelter restarts
    
     (Recasts on China aluminium, updates prices)
        BEIJING, March 12 (Reuters) - Shanghai aluminium prices
    recorded their lowest close in 14 months on Monday, three days
    before winter output curbs on Chinese smelters are set to end
    and amid fallout from looming U.S. tariffs on metal imports.
        "Concerns over the impact of a trade war instigated by the
    U.S. tariffs on aluminium and steel continue to weigh on the
    sector," ANZ wrote in a note.
        Aluminium smelters in 28 northern Chinese cities were told
    to reduce output by at least 30 percent from Nov. 15 to March
    15, although the actual volume cut was below expectations,
    putting pressure on prices.
        There may only be a limited restart from March 15 as current
    prices are not high enough for some smelters to break even,
    industry sources say, but any extra supply will hit the market
    at a time when Shanghai aluminium inventories are at a record
    high.

        * TARIFFS: The United States opened the way for more
    exemptions from its steel and aluminum tariffs on Friday, after
    pressure from allies and intense lobbying from lawmakers,

    formally announced.     
        * SHFE NICKEL: The most traded July nickel contract
    on the ShFE closed up 3.2 percent at 104,119 yuan a tonne, its

    as it tracked Friday's surge in the LME price.
        * LME NICKEL: London nickel was trading down 0.8
    percent by 0721 GMT, having leapt 4.5 percent on Friday after

    percent at $6,930 a tonne, having closed up 1.9 percent in the

     closed up 0.8 percent at 51,960 yuan a tonne.
        * COPPER: Workers in the largest union at Antofagasta PLC's
     Los Pelambres copper mine in Chile rejected an offer
    for a new labour contract, paving the way for a strike, a union
    source told Reuters on Friday.
