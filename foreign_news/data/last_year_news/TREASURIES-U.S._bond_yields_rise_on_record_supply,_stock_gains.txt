        NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields rose and
    the yield curve flattened on Monday following a lackluster
    two-year note auction, in a test of investor appetite following
    last week's strong run spurred by nervousness about a global
    trade war.
        The $30 billion two-year note supply, together with $51
    billion in three-month bills and $45 billion in six-month bills,
    were part of this week's record high $294 billion of debt.
        The Treasury Department has ratcheted up its debt issuance
    to fund higher federal spending tied to a two-year budget deal
    that was approved in February, and to make up for an expected
    drop in revenues due to the massive tax overhaul enacted in
    December.
        The bond market was also under pressure on a recovery in
    Wall Street stocks on reduced worries about a trade war.
    
        "People are concerned with supply," said Thomas Roth, head
    of U.S. Treasury trading at MUFG Securities America in New York.
    "People are leaning on the short side with bonds, but you still
    have trade concerns."
        The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose 2.4
    basis points to 2.850 percent. It hit a six-week low of 2.792
    percent on Friday.
        The modest selling in Treasuries on Monday was offset by
    lingering worries about trade tension between United States and
    its trading partners, although White House officials have aimed
    to soothe that anxiety, traders and analysts said. 
        On Friday, China urged the United States to "pull back from
    the brink" after Trump said he planned tariffs on up to $60
    billion in Chinese goods, and the Chinese commerce ministry
    warned that the country "doesn't hope to be in a trade war, but
    is not afraid of engaging in one."
        Then White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday told
    CNBC television the United States was in talks with China in an
    effort to address its trade practices.
        Easing worries about a trade war propelled U.S. stock prices
    higher and reduced the safe-haven appeal of Treasuries. They
    also reduced bets the Federal Reserve might slow its pace of
    interest rate increases if equities were to deteriorate further,
    analysts said.
        This view curbed bidding at the latest two-year note auction
    and prompted fed traders to favor longer-dated Treasuries,
    flattening the yield curve. 
        The yield gap on five-year and 30-year Treasuries
     flattened 2.1 basis points to 44.10 basis points.
        On Tuesday, the Treasury will sell $35 billion in five-year
    notes and $24 billion in one-year bills
    .
