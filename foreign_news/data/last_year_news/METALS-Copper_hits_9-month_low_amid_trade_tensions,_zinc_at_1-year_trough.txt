        MANILA, July 4 (Reuters) - London copper surrendered early
    gains and fell to a nine-month low on Wednesday, while zinc hit
    its weakest in a year as investors braced for a trade war
    between China and the United States.
        China's threatened tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. goods will
    take effect from the beginning of the day on July 6, a person
    with knowledge of the plan told Reuters, amid worsening trade
    tensions between the world's two largest economies.
        Washington has said it would implement tariffs on $34
    billion of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has vowed to
    retaliate in kind on the same day.
        If a trade war happens, "there will be some serious
    ramifications on the global economy," said Meng Jie Wu, an
    analyst at CRU consultancy in Beijing.
        Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell
    as far as $6,423 a tonne, the lowest since late September, and
    was down 0.6 percent at $6,451 by 0734 GMT. On the Shanghai
    Futures Exchange, the most-traded copper slid 2.4
    percent to close at 50,100 yuan ($7,583.67) per tonne.
        
        * ZINC, NICKEL: LME zinc dropped more than 2 percent
    to $2,731.50 a tonne, its weakest since July last year, and
    nickel hit a seven-week low of $14,185.
        * CHINA SEEKS ALLIES: China is putting pressure on the
    European Union to issue a strong joint statement against
    President Donald Trump's trade policies at a summit later this
    month but is facing resistance, European officials said.
    
        * CHINA DATA: Growth in China's services sector accelerated
    in June to a four-month high, buoyed by a pickup in new
    businesses and a sustained increase in employment, a private
    survey showed.
        * CHINA YUAN: China's yuan rose sharply against the dollar,
    a day after the central bank assured markets it would keep the
    currency stable amid heightened worries about trade frictions,
    although stocks remained under pressure.
        * GLENCORE: U.S. authorities have demanded Glencore
    hand over documents about its business in the Democratic
    Republic of Congo, Venezuela and Nigeria as part of a corruption
    probe, sending the mining company's shares down more than 8
    percent.
        * FREEPORT: Indonesia has extended a temporary operating
    permit for Freeport McMoRan Inc's Grasberg project, the
    world's second-biggest copper mine, until the end of the month
    while discussions continue over long-term rights.
