(Adds detail, updates prices) 
By Melanie Burton 
MELBOURNE, July 9 (Reuters) - London copper rebounded on Monday from a near one-year low hit in the session before, as a weak dollar forced short holders to cover positions amid simmering trade war tensions. 
"Chinese data has been weak following an extended period of tightening, and the threat of escalating trade wars is not helpful," said Jefferies in a report. 
"Slow global demand growth and increasing supply constraints should lead to tighter markets heading into 2019. Copper continues to be our preferred commodity, especially after the recent weakness." 
### FUNDAMENTALS
