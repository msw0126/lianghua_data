        By Melanie Burton
        MELBOURNE, May 21 (Reuters) - Copper edged higher on Monday
    after China and the United States put their trade row "on hold",
    easing concerns that the dispute could escalate, although
    headwinds from a stronger dollar capped further gains.     
        "It appears that America and China have moved towards a
    trade deal, which will mean the expansion of U.S. goods
    purchased by China, and thus, avoiding the prospect of an
    out-and-out trade war," said Kingdom Futures in a report. 
        The "risk on" sentiment spurred gains in Hong Kong shares
    and also metals, with the exception of aluminium, which was
    pressured by more than 100,000 tonnes of inflow last week, and
    nickel, which has not been able to beat technical resistance at
    15,000 a tonne, it said. 
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange
     was up 0.1 percent at $6,860 a tonne by 0727 GMT,
    reversing small losses from the previous session. Prices have
    been caught in a tight $6,765-$6,900 range for the past week.
        * Shanghai Futures Exchange copper also edged up by
    0.3 percent to 51,370 yuan ($8,037) a tonne.
        * TRADE: The U.S. trade war with China is "on hold" after
    the world's largest economies agreed to drop their tariff
    threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S.
    Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday.
        * DOLLAR: The dollar edged up against the yen on Monday,
    after Mnuchin's comments, boosting risk sentiment amid hopes for
    an easing of trade tensions between the world's two biggest
    economies.
        * JAPAN ECONOMY: Japan's exports accelerated in April on
    increased shipments of cars and machines used to make
    semiconductors, suggesting healthy overseas demand could help
    the economy recover quickly from a dip in the first quarter.
    
        * CHINA ECONOMY: China's economy will likely expand around
    6.7 percent in the second quarter this year, the State
    Information Center (SIC) said in an article in the state-owned
    China Securities Journal on Saturday.
        * COPPER: Vedanta Resources Plc's shutdown of its
    South Indian copper smelter, one of India's biggest, is causing
    a copper deficit and increased prices in India, its subsidiary
    Vedanta Ltd said on Friday. 
        * RUSAL: UC Rusal has not yet received any formal notice
    that sanctions target Oleg Deripaska has resigned from his board
    position at major Rusal shareholder EN+, the aluminium maker
    said on Monday.
