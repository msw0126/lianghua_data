        NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on
    Tuesday with 10-year yield hitting six-week lows as fund
    managers purchased bonds to rebalance their portfolios for
    quarter-end, offsetting sales to make room for the record high
    $294 billion in government debt this week.
        A sharp negative turn on Wall Street, which wiped out its
    earlier gains, kindled safe-haven demand for bonds.
        The U.S. Treasury Department sold $65 billion in one-month
    bills; $24 billion in one-year T-bills
     and $35 billion in five-year notes
    to average demand. The auctions on Monday and Tuesday were
    equivalent to 85 percent of the scheduled Treasuries supply this
    week.
        "There is the cash out there for these issues," said John
    Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research
    Associates in New York.
        Canavan said he expected solid bidding for $29 billion of
    seven-year notes and $15 billion in two-year
    floating-rate notes on Wednesday. 
        Lingering worries about a trade war between the United
    States and China have supported safe-haven demand for
    Treasuries, though Wall Street stock prices initially rose for a
    second day on Tuesday following last week's plunge tied to fears
    about an escalation of trade barriers between the world's two
    biggest economies.
        "Despite today's stock market rebound, 'flight-to-quality'
    sentiment may still linger given market concerns over trade
    policies, which could be supportive for demand," analysts at
    Nomura Securities International wrote in a research note.
        The share of investors who are bullish on longer-dated
    Treasuries rose to its highest level since last June, a survey
    from JPMorgan released on Tuesday showed.
        The $14.7 trillion Treasury sector was on track to generate
    about a 0.4 percent total return in March, bouncing back from
    two straight months of losses, according to an index compiled by
    Barclays and Bloomberg.
        Moreover, the Conference Board said its gauge of U.S.
    consumer confidence unexpectedly fell to 127.7 in March from a
    revised 130.0 in February. This raised some worries about
    consumer spending in the first quarter, analysts said.
    
        The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 5.9
    basis points to 2.783 percent after touching its lowest level
    since Feb. 9.
       Two-year yields were down 4.2 basis points to
    2.274 percent, while the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds
     touched a near seven-week low and was last down 4.3
    basis points to 3.028 percent.
        On Wall Street, the three major stock indexes
     turned negative in afternoon trading, dragged down by
    technology shares. 
        The U.S. bond market will close early at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT)
    on Thursday and shut for the Good Friday holiday.
