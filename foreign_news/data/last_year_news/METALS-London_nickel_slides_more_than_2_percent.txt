# METALS-London nickel slides more than 2 percent
    
     (Updates prices)
        By Melanie Burton
        MELBOURNE, Nov 9 (Reuters) - London nickel fell by more than
    2 percent on Thursday to its weakest since October as hype over
    potential electric vehicle demand that drove last week's rally
    died down. 
        The nickel market had been ignoring downside risks from
    policy developments in Indonesia and the Philippines, and
    instead was focusing on potential future demand from electric
    vehicle batteries, said Morgan Stanley in a report. 
        "We (have) heard little to alter our view that producing
    NiSO (nickel sulphate) isn't particularly challenging/costly and
    we see near-term downside risk to price," it said. 
        The bank expects annual demand for nickel from the EV sector
    to grow to 300,000 tonnes by 2025. 
                    
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * NICKEL: London nickel fell by 2.5 percent in its
    biggest one-day slide since September, while Shanghai Futures
    Exchange nickel dropped 2.2 percent. Traders said
    prices were correcting after they surged by 10 percent across an
    industry week in London last week. 
        * CHINA: Appetite for nickel has been driven up as battery
    makers increasingly turn to the base metal to help power global
    electric car sales. Demand for nickel will outstrip global
    supply for the third year in a row in 2018, according to Chinese
    state-backed research firm Antaike.
        * COPPER: London Metal Exchange copper eased by 1
    percent to $6,789.50 a tonne by 0707 GMT, erasing a small gain
    from the previous session. It matched its trough from Wednesday
    at $6,780, which was its lowest since Oct. 11. ShFE copper
     also slipped 1 percent to 53,230 yuan ($8,026) a tonne.
        * SHFE ALUMINIUM: Shanghai aluminium fell 2.7
    percent to its weakest since early August amid speculation that
    China's war on pollution could also hit manufacturers of
    aluminium products and curb demand. 
        * CHINA INFLATION: China's producer prices were surprisingly
    strong in October, while consumer inflation picked up pace,
    suggesting the world's second-largest economy remains robust
    despite expected curbs on factory output as the government
    pursues a punishing war on smog.
        * JAPAN: Japan's core machinery orders tumbled in September,
    a decline that companies expect to continue into
    October-December in a sign that business investment is losing
    momentum.
        * NICKEL: Brazil's miner Vale SA said on
    Wednesday it had received bids to invest in its New Caledonia
    nickel project as the company re-evaluates its nickel
    business.
         * POLL: Resurgent industrial metals prices, powered by
    enthusiasm for the electric vehicle (EV) revolution and a
    Chinese pollution crackdown are starting to look overcooked -
    raising the risk of a correction next year, a Reuters poll
    showed.
