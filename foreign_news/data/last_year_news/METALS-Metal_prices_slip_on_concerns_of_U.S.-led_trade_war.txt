# METALS-Metal prices slip on concerns of U.S.-led trade war
    
        MELBOURNE, March 7 (Reuters) - London metals slipped on
    Wednesday on heightened fears of a trade war that could derail
    global growth after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would
    push ahead with his plan to impose heavy tariffs on steel and
    aluminium imports. 
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * London Metal Exchange copper slipped by 0.5
    percent to $6,971 a tonne by 0223 GMT, paring a 1.4 percent gain
    from the previous session. Prices have traded in a $6,850-$7,250
    range since mid-February, bumping up against four-year highs, as
    global manufacturing has ramped up to feed construction and
    power industries in Europe, China and the United States.   
        * Shanghai Futures Exchange copper edged up by 0.3
    percent to 52,530 yuan ($8,302) a tonne.
        * U.S. ECONOMY: Economic nationalists appeared to gain the
    upper hand in a White House battle over trade with the
    resignation of Donald Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn,
    on Tuesday in a move that could ramp up protectionist measures
    and risk igniting a global trade war.
        * COPPER: "A softer dollar brought copper up above $7,000
    last night but I think fear is on again," said a trader in
    Singapore.
        * DOLLAR: The dollar extended its latest retreat on
    Wednesday after Gary Cohn announced his resignation.
        * CHINA ECONOMY: China is fully confident of its ability to
    fend off systemic debt risks while authorities expect no
    significant changes in government debt ratio in the coming
    years, finance minister Xiao Jie said on Wednesday.
        * ZINC: Brazilian miner Nexa Resources
    expects demand for zinc to outpace supply, keeping prices for
    the metal at $3,400 to $3,500 a ton for the rest of the year,
    Chief Executive Tito Martins said on Tuesday.
         * Premiums for zinc in Shanghai bond have sunk to the
    weakest since May last year at $145-170, latest data shows,
    after exchange stocks in the U.S. surged this week, soothing
    supply concerns. ZN-BMPBW-SHMET 
        * U.S. ECONOMY: New orders for U.S.-made goods recorded
    their biggest decline in six months in January and business
    spending on equipment appeared to be slowing after strong growth
    in 2017.
        * ALUMINA: A Brazilian court denied a request by Norwegian
    aluminium maker Norsk Hydro ASA to resume full
    operations at its unit Hydro Alunorte, the court said in a
    statement, in the latest setback after allegations it had
    contaminated water in the area.
