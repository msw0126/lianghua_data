# METALS-LME zinc falls sharply as sell-off resumes after Shanghai surge
    
     (Changes comment; updates prices)
        BEIJING, July 19 (Reuters) - Three-month zinc on the London
    Metal Exchange (LME) gave up early gains to trade sharply lower
    on Thursday as another broad sell-off in industrial metals took
    hold.
        Shanghai zinc had earlier jumped by the daily limit of 6
    percent to a one-week top following a report that China plans to
    boost liquidity in the banking sector, and was underpinned by
    falling inventories and a weaker yuan.
        The LME sell-off that followed came as a China foreign
    ministry spokeswoman described as "shocking" comments from U.S.
    economic adviser Larry Kudlow that Chinese President Xi Jinping
    was "holding up" a deal to resolve a trade row between the two
    countries.
        Matt France, head of Asia institutional metal sales at
    brokerage Marex Spectron, said in a note that dips in metals
    prices "continue to offer up value on an intra-day basis" but
    "the bearish trend remains intact."
     
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME ZINC: Three-month zinc on the LME rose as much
    as 2.1 percent earlier in the session, but was down 3.6 percent

    the metal gained 3.5 percent, its biggest daily jump in almost a
    year.
        * SHANGHAI ZINC: The most-traded September zinc contract on

    closing up 3.5 percent at 21,125 yuan ($3,126.99) a tonne for a
    second straight daily gain.
        * CHINA: The People's Bank of China plans to introduce
    incentives that will boost the liquidity of commercial banks,
    helping them to expand lending, according to a source with
    direct knowledge of the matter.    
        * CHINA: China's zinc output fell 5 percent year-on-year to
    475,000 tonnes in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said
    on Wednesday. 
        * OTHER METALS: Shanghai base metals closed higher across
    the board, but LME copper was trading down 2.3 percent,
    nickel down 2.6 percent and lead down 2.5
    percent in a broad sell-off.
        * COPPER: Three senior executives at Jiangxi Copper Co
    , one of China's biggest copper producers,
    have left their roles, the company said in a stock exchange
    filing on Wednesday, in a major managerial shake-up at the
    state-run firm.
