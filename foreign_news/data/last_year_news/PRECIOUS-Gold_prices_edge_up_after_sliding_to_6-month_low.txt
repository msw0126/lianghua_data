# PRECIOUS-Gold prices edge up after sliding to 6-month low
    
        BENGALURU, June 22 (Reuters) - Gold prices inched up early
    on Friday after hitting a 6-month low the session before, with
    the dollar retreating from an 11-month peak.
        
        FUNDAMENTALS  
        * Spot gold        was 0.1-percent higher at $1,268.24 an
    ounce by 0057 GMT. It touched its lowest since Dec. 19 at
    $1,260.84 on Thursday.
        * U.S. gold futures         for August delivery were nearly
    unchanged at $1,270.20 per ounce.
        * The dollar index       , which measures the greenback
    against a basket of six major currencies, stood at 94.818. It
    hit 95.529 in the previous session, its highest since mid-July
    2017.       
        * The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits
    unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to a further tightening in
    labour market conditions.             
        * An increasingly shrill exchange of words between the
    United States and China that is threatening to trigger a global
    trade war has claimed another victim - Germany's auto sector.
                
        * China's commerce ministry on Thursday accused the United
    States of being "capricious" over bilateral trade issues, and
    warned that the interests of U.S. workers and farmers ultimately
    will be hurt by Washington's penchant for brandishing "big
    sticks".             
        * Bank of Japan board member Yukitoshi Funo said on Thursday
    that the central bank needs to patiently continue its strong
    monetary easing under the current policy, as slowing inflation
    keeps the BOJ's 2 percent price target a distant objective.
                
        * Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest
    gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.50 percent to 824.63
    tonnes on Thursday.          
        * Russia produced 51.6 tonnes of gold in the first three
    months of 2018, up from 50.9 tonnes in the same period in 2017,
    the finance ministry said on Thursday.             
        * Hundreds of feet below thick boreal forest blanketing the
    Canadian Shield, a squad of near-silent, battery-powered
    machines are tunneling toward gold in a multimillion-dollar
    mining experiment to ditch diesel.             
        * Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corp          on Thursday
    said it had agreed to buy a 5-percent stake in the Yanacocha
    gold mine in Peru for $48 million, as it looks to boost its
    assets in the metals sector.
