        SINGAPORE, July 17 (Reuters) - London copper prices bounced
    back on Tuesday, with the market rising more than one percent as
    low stockpiles and technicals underpinned the market, although
    lean growth in top consumer China limited gains.
        Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange         was
    up 1.1 percent at $6,258 a tonne, as of 0419 GMT, and the
    most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
             added 0.3 percent to 49,140 yuan ($7,358.16) a tonne.
        
        INVENTORIES: Headline stocks of copper in LME-registered
    warehouses gained 1,525 tonnes to 257,200 tonnes, but were still
    at their lowest since January. MCUSTX-TOTAL
        SUPPLIES: There was additional support for the copper market
    stemming from expectations of output disruption.
        ESCONDIDA: "Copper held up relatively well, as the
    possibility of supply disruption in Chile was back in the
    headlines," ANZ said in a note. "Workers at BHP's Escondida
    copper mine rejected the company's first formal wage offer. The
    two parties are expected to head back to the negotiating table
    later this week."             
        TECHNICALS: LME copper is poised to break a resistance at
    $6,260 per tonne and rise more towards $6,370, as suggested by
    its wave pattern and a retracement analysis, according to Wang
    Wang Tao, Reuters analyst for commodities and energy technicals.
                  
        GROWTH: China's economy expanded at a slower pace in the
    second quarter as Beijing's efforts to contain debt hurt
    activity, while June factory output growth weakened to a
    two-year low in a worrying sign for investment and exporters as
    a trade war with the United States intensified.             
        TRADE WAR: China's commerce ministry said on Monday it had
    filed a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
    regarding Washington's proposed tariff list on $200 billion
    worth of Chinese goods on July 16.             
        INVESTORS: Copper speculators switched to a net short
    position of 12,919 contracts, the Commodity Futures Trading
    Commission said last week, the weakest position since December
    2016.             
        ALUMINIUM SUPPLY: China's aluminium producers are responding
    to tighter supply conditions by boosting output, data showed.
    China's June output rose by 0.8 percent to 2.83 million tonnes,
    which on a daily basis was the highest since June 2017,
    according to Reuters' calculations based on official data.
        ZINC: Shanghai zinc futures          lost 2.4 percent and
    lead          dived 2 percent on worries over Washington-Beijing
    trade war curbing demand.
