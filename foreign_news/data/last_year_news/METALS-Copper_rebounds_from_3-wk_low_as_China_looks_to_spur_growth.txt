# METALS-Copper rebounds from 3-wk low as China looks to spur growth
    
     (Adds Philippines' mining review, updates prices)
        By Manolo Serapio Jr
        MANILA, June 21 (Reuters) - London copper rebounded from a
    three-week low on Thursday after China said it was eyeing cuts
    in banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) and other measures to
    spur economic growth, which could support copper demand in the
    world's top user.
        Nickel cut intraday gains, trading near its lows, after 23
    of 27 Philippine mines passed a government review, reducing
    uncertainty about potential supply disruptions at the world's
    No.2 nickel ore supplier. 
        China's state radio quoted a cabinet meeting as saying on
    Wednesday that Beijing will use targeted reduction in RRR and
    other monetary policy tools to boost credit support for small
    firms and keep economic growth steady.
        "This suggests that a RRR cut may be imminent in the coming
    weeks, which could be supportive of market sentiment," Singapore
    bank OCBC said in a note.
        Fears of a full-blown trade war with the United States have
    magnified concerns about the outlook for China, the world's
    second-largest economy, following weaker-than-expected growth
    data for May. 
        Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was
    up 0.4 percent at $6,797 a tonne by 0705 GMT, recovering from
    Wednesday's low of $6,772, its weakest since May 30. 
        On the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the most-traded August
    copper contract slipped 0.1 percent to 51,780 yuan 
    ($7,960) a tonne. 
        
        * NICKEL PRICES: LME nickel was last up 0.2 percent
    at $15,010 a tonne after rising as much as 1.5 percent intraday
    as it tracked gains in Chinese steel futures. Shanghai
    nickel closed 1.7 percent higher at 115,150 yuan, well
    off the day's peak of 116,230 yuan. 
        * PHILIPPINES REVIEW: A Philippine government panel cleared
    23 of 27 Philippine mines that were assessed for compliance with
    state regulations, a source familiar with the talks said. All 27
    mines were ordered closed or suspended by former Environment and
    Natural Resources Secretary Regina Lopez in last year's
    crackdown. 
        * TRADE ROW: China's commerce ministry accused the United
    States of being "capricious" over bilateral trade issues, and
    warned that the interests of U.S. workers and farmers ultimately
    will be hurt by Washington's penchant for brandishing "big
    sticks".
        * U.S. PROBE: The U.S. Commerce Department is investigating
    recent steel price hikes to determine whether some market
    participants are "illegitimately profiteering" from new tariffs,
    Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.
        * COPPER SURPLUS: The global world refined copper market
    showed a 55,000 tonnes surplus in March, compared with a 87,000
    tonnes surplus in February, the International Copper Study Group
    said.
        * VEDANTA LEAK: Vedanta Ltd said a sulphuric acid
    leak from a tank at its southern Indian copper smelter was
    severe and inaction could lead to serious environmental
    consequences.
