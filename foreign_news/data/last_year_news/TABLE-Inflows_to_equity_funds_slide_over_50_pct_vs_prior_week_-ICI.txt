# TABLE-Inflows to equity funds slide over 50 pct vs prior week -ICI
    
        By David Randall
        NEW YORK, May 30 (Reuters) - U.S. investors put
    approximately $4 billion into equity mutual funds and
    exchange-traded funds in the week ending May 23, a decline of
    more than 50 percent from the previous week, according to data
    released on Wednesday by the Investment Company Institute (ICI).
        The declines were widespread, with contributions to U.S.
    stock funds dropping by 44 percent, while inflows into world
    equity funds slid by 72 percent. 
        Inflows to bond funds were largely steady, with $5.2 billion
    in new investor contributions, up about $100 million from the
    week before.
        The declines in equity fund inflows came in a week when the
    Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a two-month high and the
    Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks hit a record high for
    four straight sessions after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin
    said that the United States and China had put the prospect of a
    trade war "on hold." 
        For the year to date, the Dow  is down about 0.5
    percent, while the MSCI World Stock index is
    down 0.2 percent.
        While investor demand for U.S. equities has waned,
    corporations are making up the difference. U.S. companies
    announced $183.4 billion in share buybacks during the most
    recent earnings season, according to TrimTabs Investment
    Research, the second-most on record. 
        The following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual
    funds and ETFs (all figures in millions of dollars):
