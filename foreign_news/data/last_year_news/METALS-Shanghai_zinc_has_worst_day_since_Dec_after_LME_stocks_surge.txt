# METALS-Shanghai zinc has worst day since Dec after LME stocks surge
    
     (Updates prices)
        BEIJING, March 6 (Reuters) - Shanghai zinc futures fell more
    than 2 percent on Tuesday, their steepest drop in three months,
    tracking a decline in prices on the London Metal Exchange after
    LME warehouse inventories climbed.
        The metal, used to galvanise steel, is also coming under
    pressure after President Donald Trump said the United States
    would impose a tariff of 25 percent on steel imports. 
        A number of countries, including China and Canada, have
    criticised the move, sparking talk of a trade war. Trump also
    vowed to impose a 10 percent duty on aluminium imports.
        "Trade war fears continue to overhang the markets ...
    causing headwinds for LME metals," broker Sucden Financial said
    in a note on Tuesday.     
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * SHFE ZINC: The most-traded April zinc contract on
    the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed down 2.1 percent at 25,450 
    yuan ($4,011) a tonne, in its biggest daily drop since Dec. 6.
    It earlier touched 25,210 yuan a tonne, its lowest since Dec.
    15.
        * LME ZINC: Three-month LME zinc was little changed at
    $3,292.50 a tonne at 0729 GMT, after hitting a 2018 low in the
    previous session. Stocks of zinc in LME warehouses MZN-STOCKS
    jumped by 59 percent on Monday to 209,050 tonnes, and on-warrant
    stocks - those not earmarked for delivery - nearly doubled to
    162,825 tonnes. 
        * LME COPPER: London copper rose 0.5 percent to
    $6,945 on a weaker dollar. A softer greenback makes metals
    cheaper for holders of other currencies and can support prices
    
        * SHFE METALS: The most-traded April copper contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange edged up 0.6 percent to
    52,420 yuan a tonne, while lead shed 1 percent.
        * TRUMP TARIFF PLAN: Trump faced growing pressure from
    political and diplomatic allies as well as U.S. companies urging
    him to pull back from proposed steel and aluminium tariffs,
    although he said he would stick to his guns.
        * INDONESIA: Indonesia's President Joko Widodo has
    instructed his administration to complete negotiations over the
    purchase of a majority stake in Freeport-McMoRan Inc's
    local unit by the end of April, a cabinet minister said on
    Monday.
        * COBALT: Australia's Celsius Resources, which has
    made Namibia's first cobalt discovery, is aiming to start
    production from the remote mine in 2020, the company's managing
    director said.
