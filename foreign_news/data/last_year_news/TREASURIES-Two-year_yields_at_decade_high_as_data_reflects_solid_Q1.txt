# TREASURIES-Two-year yields at decade high as data reflects solid Q1
    
        By Kate Duguid
        NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - - Short-dated Treasury yields
    continued to rise on Tuesday, driving the yield curve to its
    flattest level in over a decade, as economic data from March
    supported further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in
    2018. 
        U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in March amid
    a rebound in the construction of multi-family housing units,
    despite weakness in the single-family segment. The data followed
    a report Monday from the U.S. Commerce Department that showed
    retail sales in March rose 0.6 percent, after three months of
    declines.
        "We're closing out the quarter on more solid footing than we
    had seen in January and February," said John Herrmann, director
    of U.S. rates strategies at MUFG Securities in New York.
        "Even with the bad weather in March, the data has really
    strengthened, supporting the view that the Fed will most likely
    have to hike rates in June," said Herrmann. 
        The spread between two- and 10-year Treasury bond yields
     hit 43.20 basis points, its lowest level since
    August 2007. The spread between five- and 30-year yields
     fell to 32.60 basis points, a low of more than a
    decade. 
        The stability of short-term economic growth, however, may be
    threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist trade
    policies. The United States and China have threatened each other
    with tens of billions of dollars in tariffs in recent weeks,
    fanning worries of a full blown trade war that threatens global
    supply chains and investment plans.
        Threatening the story of American growth is "the persistent
    risk from the Trump administration ... which periodically comes
    up with policy suggestions that can run counter to U.S. growth
    in the short- to intermediate-term," said Herrmann. 
        In addition to steady economic data, U.S. corporate earnings
    being reported this week indicate strength in the equity market,
    which is supportive of higher bond yields. Wall Street indexes
    rose on Tuesday as strong earnings from Netflix,
    Goldman Sachs and healthcare companies boosted optimism
    over what is expected to be the strongest earnings season in
    seven years.
        The benchmark 10-year government bond was last
    at 2.834 slightly above its last close at 2.832. The two-year
    yield was last up at 2.399, its highest level since
    August 2008.
