# EMERGING MARKETS-Trade war fears knock LatAm markets; Argentine peso up
    
        By Bruno Federowski
        BRASILIA, June 18 (Reuters) - Escalating fears of a damaging
    trade war between the United States and China drove Latin
    American currencies lower on Monday and knocked blue-chip stocks
    across the region, but central bank action supported the
    Argentine peso.
         The United States on Friday detailed $50 billion of Chinese
    imports to face 25 percent tariffs. The move prompted a swift
    response from Beijing, which said it would sanction $50 billion
    of U.S. imports and suspend all previous trade agreements with
    the Trump administration.
        Trade friction concerns between the world's top two
    economies have weighed on demand for riskier, emerging-market
    assets through the year, a trend that persisted in Latin America
    on Monday.
        Currencies from Brazil, Mexico, Chile
     and Colombia weakened between 0.5 and 1 percent.
        "After the confirmation of the U.S. protectionist attack,
    risk aversion is exerting substantial pressure over markets,"
    analysts at Nova Futura brokerage wrote in a client note.
        The Argentine peso, however, jumped 2.7 percent,
    after the central bank said it will hike reserve requirements
    for banks by 5 percentage points in a move expected to absorb
    100 billion pesos ($3.63 billion) from the financial system
    after the latest run on the currency.
        Stocks markets also fell throughout the region, tracking a
    wider emerging market slump as MSCI's emerging market index
     fell for a fourth straight day.
        Blue-chip stocks, such as Brazilian state-controlled oil
    company Petróleo Brasileiro SA, miner Vale SA
     and lender Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, led
    declines.
