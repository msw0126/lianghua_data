# METALS-Base metals rise as trade war fears fade
    
     (Adds broker comment; updates prices)
        BEIJING, March 27 (Reuters) - Base metal prices climbed on
    Tuesday, lifted by a rebound in equities on hopes that a trade
    war between top metals consumer China and the United States may
    be avoided. 
        Senior U.S. officials are asking China to cut tariffs on
    imported cars, allow foreign majority ownership of financial
    services firms and buy more U.S.-made semiconductors in
    negotiations to avoid plans to slap tariffs on a host of Chinese
    goods.
        "With headlines... becoming slightly less negative it seems
    people have been encouraged to unwind the armageddon trade and
    this is seeing short-covering across the board both West and in
    Asia," broker Marex Spectron said in a note.
        Metals prices had fallen to multi-month lows last week after
    U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on
    up to $60 billion of Chinese goods, and Beijing threatened to
    respond.
          
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal
    Exchange rose 1.5 percent to $6,698.50 a tonne by 0710
    GMT, having touched a low of $6,532 in the previous session, its
    weakest since early December. 
        * SHFE COPPER: The most traded May contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) closed up 0.1 percent at 49,620
    yuan ($7,938.56) a tonne.
        * USD: The U.S. dollar index was flat at 89.01,
    having hit a five-week low against a basket of major currencies
    late on Monday. A weaker dollar makes metals cheaper for holders
    of other currencies, supporting prices.
        * CHILE: Workers at Antofagasta Plc's Los Pelambres
    copper mine in Chile reached an agreement on a new labour
    contract, defusing the risk of a strike, the union said on
    Monday.
        * STRIKES: With several other key labour contracts up for
    renewal, the "risk of copper supply disruptions due to strikes
    is still high as workers demand higher wages while mining
    companies are in austerity mode and strongly against locking in
    higher fixed costs in perpetuity," Jefferies said.    
        * ALUMINIUM: Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro
     said it would release on April 9 conclusions from its
    internal review and a review it ordered from green consultancy
    SGW Services on spills that took place at its Alunorte alumina
    refinery in Brazil.    
        * OTHER METALS: Zinc was trading 0.8 percent higher
    in London and closed up 1.4 percent in Shanghai. Nickel
    was the only base metal to fall in Shanghai, closing down 0.4
    percent after customs data on Monday showed China's refined
    nickel imports fell 7.9 percent in February.

        * Asian share markets sprang higher on Tuesday as reports of
    behind-the-scenes talks between the United States and China
    rekindled hopes that a damaging trade war could be averted, in
    turn sapping life from the dollar and yen.
