# METALS-Base metals rise as trade war fears ease
    
        BEIJING, March 27 (Reuters) - Most base metals prices
    climbed on Tuesday, lifted by a rebound in equities on hopes
    that a trade war between top metals consumer China and the
    United States may be avoided. 
        Senior U.S. officials are asking China to cut tariffs on
    imported cars, allow foreign majority ownership of financial
    services firms and buy more U.S.-made semiconductors in
    negotiations to avoid plans to slap tariffs on a host of Chinese
    goods.
    
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal
    Exchange rose by 1.3 percent to $6,686 a tonne by 0212
    GMT, having closed down 0.9 percent and touched a low of $6,532
    on Monday, its weakest since early December.   
        * LME COPPER: Copper inventories in LME warehouses
    MCUSTOX-TOTAL grew by 35,000 tonnes to 352,750 tonnes,
    exchange data showed on Monday. On-warrant stocks have nearly
    doubled this year and are at their most elevated since September
    2016. 
        * SHFE COPPER: The most traded May contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) was up 0.3 percent at 49,680
    yuan ($7,931.41) a tonne.
        * CHILE: Workers at Antofagasta PLC's Los Pelambres
    copper mine in Chile reached an agreement on a new labour
    contract, defusing the risk of a strike, the union said on
    Monday. 
        * USD: The U.S. dollar index was up 0.1 percent to
    89.1, having hit a five-week low against a basket of major
    currencies late on Monday. A weaker dollar makes metals cheaper
    for holders of other currencies, supporting prices.
        * ZINC: Zinc was trading up 0.8 percent at $3,285 a
    tonne, having earlier touched a two-week high of $3,288. It was
    up 1.5 percent in Shanghai after customs data on Monday
    showed that China's zinc imports jumped by 151 percent in
    February.
        * COMEX: Hedge funds and money managers cut their net long
    positions in COMEX gold and copper contracts in the week to
    March 20, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data
    showed on Friday.

        * Asian share markets rallied on Tuesday as reports of
    behind-the-scenes talks between the United States and China
    rekindled hopes a damaging trade war could be averted, in turn
    sapping the strength of the dollar and yen.
