# METALS-Shanghai copper edges up, but set for worst quarter since 2013
    
        BEIJING, March 30 (Reuters) - Shanghai copper prices edged
    up on Friday as the dollar weakened, making metals cheaper for
    holders of other currencies, but were set to post their steepest
    quarterly drop since 2013 after recent fears of a U.S.-China
    trade war spooked markets.
        The London Metal Exchange is closed on Friday and Monday for
    the Easter holiday.
            
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded May copper contract on the
    Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 0.5 percent at 49,900
    yuan ($7,949.91) a tonne by 0220 GMT.
        * SHFE COPPER: Shanghai copper is on course to lose 11.2
    percent this quarter. That would mark its worst quarterly
    performance since the second quarter of 2013, with a 5.8 percent
    drop in March alone - its worst month since November 2015.
        * SHFE ALUMINUM: The most traded May aluminium contract on
    the ShFE was down 0.9 percent at 13,665 yuan a tonne.
    It earlier touched 13,630 yuan a tonne, and is on track for its
    worst quarter since the second quarter of 2010 after winter
    supply cuts in China were below expectations.
        * CHILE: A union representing the majority of workers at
    Codelco's            Radomiro Tomic mine in Chile has rejected a
    final offer for a new labour contract, forcing a period of
    government-facilitated mediation, the company said on Thursday.
    
        * CODELCO: Chile's state copper company Codelco said on
    Thursday it produced 1.734 million tonnes of copper in 2017, its
    second highest output ever, despite persistently low ore grades
    at its ageing mines.
        * RIO: Swiss prosecutors on Thursday confirmed they were
    checking whether "questionable payments" to an ex-Mongolian
    finance minister were linked to Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi
    mining project, adding the Anglo-Australian mining company was
    "not an accused".
        * ALUMINIUM: Japan's aluminium industry on Thursday called
    for the United States to scrap import tariffs on aluminium,
    claiming that they are against international rules and pose a
    serious problem for the industry and global trade and economic
    growth.
        * DRC: International mining firms including Glencore
     and <Randgold RRS.L> on Thursday proposed a sliding
    scale for royalty rates on key commodities mined in Democratic
    Republic of Congo as an alternative to a windfall tax.

    their first quarterly drop in two years.
