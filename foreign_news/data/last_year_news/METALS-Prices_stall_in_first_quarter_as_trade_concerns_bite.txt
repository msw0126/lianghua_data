# METALS-Prices stall in first quarter as trade concerns bite
    
     (Updates prices)
        MELBOURNE, March 29 (Reuters) - London copper moved higher
    on Thursday but has dropped by around 7 percent in the first
    quarter, reflecting complex-wide losses on fears that an
    escalating trade spat could slow the demand for metals.
        Concerns that worsening trade relations between China and
    the United States could spill across into other countries have
    fuelled worries about a slowdown in China, which is already
    seeing inventories build, said analyst Helen Lau at broker
    Argonaut in Hong Kong. 
        "Overall the inventory after China's new year did not come
    down as much as the industry expected," she said. 
        "China's economic slowdown and the escalating trade war
    concerns... All of this is pointing towards headwinds for
    commodity demand."
        
        FUNDAMENTALS
        * LME: London Metal Exchange copper was up 1 percent
    at $6,729 a tonne by 0703 GMT, having stabilised in the previous
    session. Prices this week fell to their weakest since early
    December at $6,532 a tonne and are on course for a 7.1 percent
    loss for the first quarter after double-digit growth for the
    past two years. 
        * SHFE: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper closed up
    0.8 percent at 49,880 yuan ($7,935.60) a tonne, having plumbed
    this week to its weakest since July.
        * HOLIDAY: The LME will be closed on Friday, March 30, and
    Monday, April 2, for the Easter holiday, with normal trading
    resuming on Tuesday.
        * TARIFFS: U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese
    goods may not be imposed until early June, administration
    officials said on Wednesday, with public consultations and
    potential tariff revisions buying time for negotiations to
    forestall them.
        * TARIFFS: China is still considering import curbs on U.S.
    soybeans in retaliation for moves by Washington to impose trade
    tariffs, director at the U.S. Soybean Export Council Asia Paul
    Burke said.
        * CHINA: China will lower the value-added tax rate on the
    manufacturing, transportation, construction, telecommunication
    and agricultural sectors from May 1, state radio reported,
    citing a cabinet meeting.
        * TRADE: China could target a broad range of U.S. businesses
    from agriculture to aircraft, autos, semiconductors and even
    services if the trade conflict with the United States escalates,
    the China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Thursday. 
    
        * COPPER: Jiangxi Copper Co Ltd, one
    of China's biggest copper smelters, said on Wednesday its 2017
    net profit more than doubled, growing at the fastest pace in
    seven years, mainly due to higher copper prices.
